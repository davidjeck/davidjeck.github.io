<p>Independent work is an important part of the experience of many students
at <A HREF="http://www.hws.edu/">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</A>.
Many students do independent studies and honors work.</p>

<P>An independent study is a one-term project that counts as a course.
Many students use independent studies as a way of covering material
not found in our regular courses.  Others do special projects, such as
a single large-scale programming project.  Generally, a student doing
independent study meets twice a week with the professor supervising
the course.</p>

<P>An Honors Project is a full-year project, usually undertaken in
the senior year.  It is equivalent of several independent studies on
a single topic, except that it must result in a long paper (generally
on the order of fifty to one hundred pages) and it culminates in
an oral examination administered by three examiners.</p>

<P>Another oportunity for independent work is offered by summer research
projects supported by the Colleges.  Project proposals are
funded competatively.  A student who is awarded one of these summer research grants
works intensively on a project for about eight weeks.</p>

<P>This is a list of the Honors projects, independent study courses,
and summer research projects supervised by Professor
