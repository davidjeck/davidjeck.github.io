<p>What can you do with thirty-two bits?
Computers use strings of bits to represent all the different types
of data that they have to work with, so the answer must be that you
can do a lot of different things.  A given string of
32 bits can represent all kinds of things, depending on the context
in which it is used.  That is, the same bits can encode different
things, depending on how they are interpreted.</p>

<p>This page contains
an applet that lets you see different interpretations of the
same 32-bit binary number.
The applet lets you type in a data value.  You can select the type of data
you want to enter by clicking on one of the five radio buttons.  Just type
your data into the input box at the top of the applet, and press return.
You can also click on the 8-by-4 grid of &quot;big pixels&quot; at the
center of the applet.  The various data representations are described 
<a href="#reps">below</a>.<p>

<p>This applet
was originally written by <A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html">David&nbsp;Eck</A>
for use with his introductory computer science textbook
<cite><A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The&nbsp;Most&nbsp;Complex&nbsp;Machine</A></cite>.
However, it can also be used on its own.</p>

<p>The Data Representation Applet shows six different
interpretations for the same string of thirty-two
bits.  The six interpretations are: a binary number, an integer, 
a hexadecimal number, a real
number, a string of four characters and an eight-by-four grid of
pixels. Here is a short explanation of each of the six data displays.</p>

<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Binary</font>
<DD>This is the most direct display of the
32 bit binary number, showing a zero or one to represent each 
individual bit.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Base-ten Integer</font>
<DD> A binary number can be 
interpreted as a normal positive integer (0, 1, 2, 3, 4,...) written in
the &quot;base ten&quot;. 
With 32 bits, you can represent 2<sup>32</sup> different numbers.  Usually,
you want to use both positive and negative numbers.  The scheme for representing
negative numbers is a bit strange.  It is explained in Subsection 2.2.3 of
<cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>.
Using 32 bits, the integers from -2147483648 to 2147483647 can be represented.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Hexadecimal</font>
<DD>It is difficult (for humans) to read
long strings of zeros and ones.  Hexadecimal numbers are a kind of shorthand
for writing such strings.  A hexadecimal number is written using the
sixteen &quot;hexadecimal digits&quot; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Each hexadecimal digit stands for four bits.
So 0 represents 0000, 1 represents 0001, 2 represents 0010, ..., E represents
1110, and F represents 1111.  We could also say that in the base ten, the
hexadecimal digit A stands for the number 10 (ten), B stands for 11 (eleven),
C stands for 12, D for 13, E for 14, and F for 15.
A 32-bit binary number can be expressed as an 8-digit hexadecimal number.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Real Number</font>
<DD>Real numbers are numbers that can contain decimal points, like 3.14159 or
-234.5, or 12.0.  They can also be written using &quot;scientific notation.&quot;
For example, 2.15e12 is a way of writing 2.15 times 10<sup>12</sup>.  The representation
used in computers for real numbers is very complicated.  And it allows some strange
possibilities, such as INF and -INF, which stand for infinity and minus infinity.
There are also NAN's.  NAN stands for &quot;not a number.&quot;  NAN's are used
to represent the results of illegal operations such as taking a square root of
a negative number.  Note that the <b>integer</b> 17 and the <b>real number</b>
17 have completely different representations in the computer, even though 
they are the same number mathematically.
I will not describe the representation of real numbers in detail.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">ASCII Text</font>
<DD>Characters can be encoded using ASCII code.
Each possible character is assigned a code that is one byte (that is, 
eight bits) long.  With 32 bits, you can represents 4 characters in ASCII code.
Not every possible byte represents an ordinary, printable character.  The applet
shows other bytes in the form &lt;#n&gt;, where n is the base-ten number corresponding
to the byte.  For example, the byte 00000111, which is equivalent to 7 in base ten,
is shown as &lt;#7&gt;.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Pixels</font>
<DD>At the center of the applet, you will see an 8-by-4 grid of little squares.
Each of these thirty-two squares corresponds to one byte in the binary number.
You should think of these squares as being very big pixels.  Each pixel can
be either black or white.  One bit specifies the color of one pixel -- 0 for
white or 1 for black.  This is how two-color graphical images can be represented
by binary numbers.  Again, see Section 1.1 of the text.  In the applet, you can
change the color of a pixel by clicking on it.
