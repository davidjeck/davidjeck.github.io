<p><font size="+2">T</font>URING MACHINES are very simple computational
devices.  A Turing machine has an infinitely long tape, divided into
<font color="#E70000">cells</font>.
Each cell can be blank or can contain a <font color="#E70000">symbol</font>
chosen from some fixed finite list.  The Turing machine moves along the tape
reading and writing symbols.  It has an internal <font color="#E70000">state</font>,
which can be either the <font color="#E70000">halt state</font> or
an integer between zero and some specified maximum value.  When a 
Turing machine enters the halt state, it stops computing.  Although
Turing machines are very simple, any computation that can be done
by any computer can also be done by some Turing machine.</p>

<p>The action that a Turing machine takes depends only on its
state and on the symbol displayed in the cell where the machine is currently
located.  Given this information, the Turing machine takes three
actions: It writes a symbol to the cell (possibly the same one that is
already there); it moves one cell to the left or one cell to the right;
and it sets its internal state (possibly to the same state that it is
currently in).  The Turing machine has
a table of <font color="#E70000">rules</font> that tells it what to
do for various combinations of its current state and the symbol it
reads from the current cell.</p>

<p>The xTuringMachine applet is designed to show Turing machines in
action.  The Turing machines that it works with have a maximum of
25 states, and they can only use the symbols 0, 1, x, y, z, and $.
Nevertheless, they can do some non-trivial computations.  The
applet is set up to load several sample machines.
More information about the applet can be found <A HREF="#info">below</A>.

<p>This applet
was originally written by <A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html">David&nbsp;Eck</A>
for use with his introductory computer science textbook
<cite><A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The&nbsp;Most&nbsp;Complex&nbsp;Machine</A></cite>.
However, it can also be used on its own.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><a name="info">About the Applet</a></font></H3>

<p>A pop-up menu at the very top of the applet can be used to select
machines that were loaded by the applet at start-up or that have been
created by the user.  Selecting &quot;[New]&quot;, the first item in
the menu, will create a new, empty machine.</p>

<p>Just below the applet is the machine itself, sitting on an infinite
tape.  The tape is divided into cells, and each cell either contains a
symbol or is blank.  The machine itself sits over one of the cells
and displays its current state.  By convention, the machine starts out
in state zero.  When it is in the halt state, it displays an &quot;h&quot;.
(This area of the screen is also used to display messages; the machine
will be there when you dismiss the message.)</p>

<p>On the left side of the applet below the machine is a set of
controls.  The first control is a pop-up menu that controls the speed
of the applet when it computes.  The &quot;Run&quot; button makes
the machine start computing; when you click it, it changes into
a &quot;Stop&quot; button.  The &quot;Step&quot; button makes the
machine perform one step in its computation.  The &quot;Clear Tape&quot;
button does just that.  The &quot;Delete Rule&quot; button can be used
to delete one rule from the rule table.  (It is only active when
a rule has been selected.  The selected rule is shown in red; you
can select a rule by clicking on it.)  The &quot;Load File&quot;
and &quot;Save&quot; buttons are used to work with files.  Your browser
might not permit you to use them.</p>

<p>The table of rules is in the lower right section of the applet.  Each
rule tells the machine what to do if it is in a certain state and if
it reads a certain symbol.  The &quot;Move&quot; column tells the machine
which direction to move: &quot;L&quot; for left and &quot;R&quot; for
right.  You can edit the &quot;Write,&quot; &quot;Move,&quot;
and &quot;New State&quot; columns.</p>

<p>The columns labeled &quot;Reading&quot; and &quot;Write&quot;
can contain the symbols $, 0, 1, x, y, and z.  They can also contain
the character &quot;#&quot;, which is used to represent a blank cell.
The &quot;Reading&quot; column might also contain &quot;other&quot;,
which represents a <font color="#E70000">default</font> value that
means &quot;any other symbol for which no explicit rule is given.&quot;
If the &quot;Reading&quot; column contains &quot;other&quot;,
then the &quot;Write&quot; column can contain &quot;same&quot;,
which tells the machine to write the same character that it read.</p>

<p>Just above the rule table is a &quot;rule maker&quot; with a
&quot;Make Rule&quot; button that can be used to add new rules to the
table.  The blue rectangle between the machine and the rule maker
is a &quot;palette&quot; that is used in making and editing rules,
changing the contents of the tape, and changing the current state
of the machine.  This is explained in the next two sections.</p>

<p>When the machine is running at &quot;Moderate&quot; speed or
slower, after each step the applet displays the next applicable
rule in the rule maker box -- so you can see why the machine takes
the action it does.  If there is <b>no</b> applicable rule in
a give situation, the machine will stop and will display the
message &quot;No Rule Defined!&quot;  You could then use the
rule maker to make the missing rule.</p>

<p>If the machine moves outside the applet as it is computing,
the machine along with its tape will jerk back about 1/4 of
the width of the applet.  (By the way, if you somehow lose the
machine off the edge of the applet, clicking the &quot;Run&quot;
or &quot;Step&quot; button will make it reappear.)</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000">Using the Mouse</font></H3>

<p>It is possible to work with the xTuringMachine applet using
only the mouse (and completely avoiding the keyboard).  Here's how.</p>

<p>Before you can edit any item, it must be &quot;hilited.&quot;
The currently hilited item, if any, is surrounded by
a bright blue-green outline.  You can always hilite an editable item
by clicking on it.  Whenever an item is hilted, the palette will
display a list of legal values for that item.  (The palette is the
blue rectangle just below the machine.)  You can choose one
of these values by clicking on it.  You can also type the value you
want.</p>

<p>As long as the Turing machine is not running, you
can edit the current state of the machine and the contents of
the tape.  Click on the machine or on one of the tape's cells, then
select a value from the palette.  When you enter a symbol for
the tape, the hilite moves one cell to the right.</p>

<p>You can edit the &quot;Write&quot;, &quot;Move&quot;, and
&quot;New State&quot; columns of the rule table at any time,
even while the machine is running.  Click on the item you want to
change, then select a value from the palette.</p>

<p>The rule maker is somewhat more complicated.  The rule maker lets
you set up one rule by editing any of the five values for that
rule.  To set up the rule, click on any of the values in the rule
maker and edit it by selecting one of the values in the palette.
When the rule is complete, click on the &quot;Make Rule&quot;
button to add it to the rules table.
(However, if the &quot;In State&quot; and &quot;Reading&quot;
items in the rule maker are the same as those for an existing
rule, the &quot;Make Rule&quot; button becomes a &quot;Replace&quot;
button. When you click it, the rule in the rule maker will replace
the rule in the table.)  Everytime you make or replace a rule,
the rule maker is automatically updated to show the next
consecutive rule, since it is at least fairly likely that that is the
rule you want to work on next.</p>

<p>You can use the mouse to drag the Turing machine into a new
position on its tape or to drag the tape to a new position under
the machine.  If you want to drag them both together, use the
right mouse button or hold down the Control key as you click.</p>

<hr>
<H3><font color="#E70000">Using the Keyboard</font></H3>

<p>You can use the keyboard to perform any editing task in the
xTuringMachine applet.  Here's how.</p>

<p>Pressing the tab key will move the hilite among the three major
areas: the machine, the rule maker, and the rule table. (If there is
no hilited item, pressing the tab key <b>might</b> create a hilite
in the rule maker; if not, you have to use the mouse.) Within one these three major
areas, the up, down, left, and right arrow keys can be used
to move the hilite from one item to another.  When the hilite is
in the tape or in the rule table, the &quot;home&quot; and &quot;end&quot;
keys can also be used.  Play around to see how they work.</p>

<p>You can always type one of the values displayed in the palette,
instead of clicking on it.  Note that a blank can be entered either
by pressing the space bar or by typing a #.  The default symbol
(&quot;other&quot; in the &quot;Reading&quot; column or &quot;same&quot;
in the &quot;Write&quot; column) is entered by typing a *.</p>

<p>When working in the rule maker, hitting the return key is the
same as clicking on the &quot;Make Rule&quot; (or &quot;Replace&quot;)
button.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000">The Sample Machines</font></H3>

<p>The applet on this page is set up to load four sample Turing machines.
Here are brief descriptions:</p>

<UL>
<LI><b>CopyXYZ.txt</b>: This machine expects to be started on the
left end of a sequence of symbols containing only x's, y's, and z's.
It will make a copy of its input, and will halt on the left end of
the copy.
<LI><b>GatherDollars.txt</b>:  This machine should be started on the
left end of a string of symbols.  Any of the symbols $, 0, 1, x, y, and
z are OK. The machine will move all the $'s to the left end of
the string of symbols, leaving all the other symbols in the original
order.  It halts on the left end of the string.
<LI><b>CountInBinary.txt</b>: Expects to be started on the
right end of a sequence of zeros and ones, which is interpreted
as a binary number.  The machine adds one to its input, and repeats
this process forever.  If started on a blank tape, it will start
counting from one.  Run it at &quot;Fastest&quot; speed.
<LI><b>BinaryAddition.txt</b>:  The input for this machine should be
two binary numbers, separated by a blank.  The machine should be started
on the right end of the second number.  It computes the sum of the
two binary numbers.  The second number is erased in the process.  The
first number is replaced by the sum.  The machine halts on the right
end of the sum.
