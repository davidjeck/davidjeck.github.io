<H1 align=center><font color="#E70000">The xTurtle Programming Applet</font></H1>

<p>The applet at the bottom of this page -- assuming that you have
a Java-enabled browser -- lets you write and run programs written in 
the &quot;xTurtle&quot; programming language.  This applet was
written by <A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html">David&nbsp;Eck</A>
for use with his introductory computer science textbook
<cite><A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The&nbsp;Most&nbsp;Complex&nbsp;Machine</A></cite>.
However, it can also be used on its own.  The xTurtle language is designed to be
simple enough to learn easily, but complex enough to teach some important programming
concepts.</p>

<p><font color"#E70000">The applet below</font> is set up to load some
sample programs.  Use the pop-up menu in the upper left corner of the
applet, and click on the <b>Run Program</b> button to see what it does.
Full information is available about the applet and the xTurtle language
on <A HREF="info.html">xTurtle&nbsp;Info</A> page.  A set of
<A HREF="tutorial.html">tutorial&nbsp;examples</A> is also available.
</p>

<p>For a list of other applets and for lab worksheets that use the applets,
see the <A HREF="../index.html">index&nbsp;page</A>.</p>
