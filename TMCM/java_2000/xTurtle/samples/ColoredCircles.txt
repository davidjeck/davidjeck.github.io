{ This program draws some randomly colored
  circles, all intersecting at the center
  of the turtle graphics area.  After each
  circle is drawn, the turtle rotates by
  5 degrees.  It stops when its heading is
  zero, that is, when it is facing to the
  right. 
  
  By the way, { and } enclose a comment,
  which is ignored by the computer.  }
