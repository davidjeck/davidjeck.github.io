<hr>

<p><font size="+2">S</font>ORTING a list of items -- that is, arranging the items
into increasing or decreasing order -- is a common operation.  It is also the most
common example in the &quot;analysis of algorithms,&quot; which is the study
of computational procedures and of the amount of time and memory that they
require.  The xSortLab applet knows five different sorting methods.
It has a visual sorting mode, where you can watch as sixteen
bars are sorted into increasing order.  And it has a timed mode, where
you can measure the time it takes to sort a large number of items.
The applet is easy to use (but you probably won't quite get the point of
it unless you already know something about sorting).
More information about the applet can be found <A HREF="#info">below</A>.

<p>This applet
was originally written by <A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html">David&nbsp;Eck</A>
for use with his introductory computer science textbook
<cite><A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The&nbsp;Most&nbsp;Complex&nbsp;Machine</A></cite>.
However, it can also be used on its own.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><a name="info">Visual Sort Mode</a></font></H3>

<p>The xSortLab applet can display three different panels: a panel for 
&quot;Visual Sort,&quot; a panel for &quot;Timed Sort,&quot; and
a &quot;Log&quot; panel.  There is a pop-up menu at the top of the
applet that can be used to switch among the three panels.  (<b>Note</b>: Changing
panels while a sort is in progress will abort the sort.)</p>

<p>The applet starts in &quot;Visual Sort&quot; mode, in which 16 bars are
sorted step-by-step using one of the sorting algorithms Bubble Sort, Selection Sort,
Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, or QuickSort.  Below the area where the bars are
displayed are two message areas, which display a running commentary when
a sort is in progress.  The lower message area displays a detailed comment
on each step in the sort.  The upper area displays more general messages
about major phases in the sort.  (The lower message area is not used when
the sort is being run at &quot;Fast&quot; speed.)</p>

<p>To the right of the bars is a column of controls.  The first of these
is a pop-up menu, that can be used to select the sorting method.  (Again, doing
this in the middle of a sort will abort the current sort.)  Next comes
a checkbox that can be used to determine whether or not the sort is done
at &quot;Fast&quot; speed.  When this box is <b>not</b> checked, you get to
see a cute animation of moving bars; also, a longer delay is inserted between
steps when you run the sort with the &quot;Go&quot; button.  The &quot;Go&quot;
and &quot;Step&quot; buttons are used for executing a sort. The
&quot;Start Again&quot; button gives you a new, randomized list of 16 bars.</p>

<p>Two basic operations are used in sorting:  <font color="#E70000">comparing</font> two items to
see which is bigger and <font color="#E70000">copying</font> an item from one place to another.  The number
of comparisons and the number of copies used in the current sort are
displayed below the controls.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000">Timed Sort Mode</font></H3>

<p>If you switch to the &quot;Timed Sort&quot; panel, you'll see a large
message area, with some instructions.  This panel is used to obtain
statistics about the running times of various running algorithms.  The 
interesting question is how the running time depends on the number of
items being sorted.  There is a text-input box at the top of
the panel where you can specify the size of the array that is to be
sorted.  You can also specify the number of arrays to be sorted.
The point is that a small array takes so little time to sort that
the time cannot be measured accurately.  So, you should sort a number of
arrays, all of the same size.  You can measure the total time it takes
to sort them all.  The time required to sort one array can be obtained
by dividing the total time by the number of arrays.  You probably
want to adjust the number of arrays so that the total time is at
least a couple of seconds.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Your computer must have enough memory to store all the
numbers you want to sort.  (If you are running the applet at all, you 
probably have enough memory to work with at least one million items.)
If you ask for more numbers than you have room for, you <b>should</b>
just a message telling you that you don't have enough memory.  However,
most systems that I have tried this on have crashed.  This is a bug.
You are warned.  Stick to a reasonable number of items.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the panel are a pop-up menu that you can use to
choose the sort method and a &quot;Go&quot; button that you can click
to start the sort.  (This changes to &quot;Abort&quot; while a sort
is in progress.)</p>

<p>When you begin a sort, the first thing the computer does is to
fill up the arrays with random numbers.  If there are a lot of numbers,
this will take a noticeable amount of time.  Then, the computer begins
to sort.  As the sorting operation proceeds, statistics are displayed
about twice per second.  The statistics include the number of comparison
and copy operations that have been performed, the number of arrays that
have been sorted so far, the elapsed time since the computer began sorting,
and the approximate compute time that the computer has devoted to sorting.
The compute time is not the same as the elapsed time, since the applet
is doing other things besides sorting (such as redrawing the screen).
The applet tries to use 80% of the time for sorting, and to leave 20%
for other tasks.  The applet can measure the 20% of its time that it
gives away voluntarily, but if other things are going on in your computer,
it might lose some other time that it can't measure.  This is
why the measured compute time is approximate.  So, you should <b>not</b>
try to run a timed sort in the background!  Just sit and watch -- or go
get a coffee.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000">The Log</font></H3>

<p>Every time a sort completes successfully, statistics about that sort 
are written to a log.  For a visual sort, the number of copies and the
number of comparisons are recorded.  For a timed sort, all the statistics
that are displayed in the &quot;Timed Sort&quot; panel are written to
the log.  You can view this log by selecting the &quot;Log&quot;
option from the pop-up menu at the top of the applet.</p>

<p>The Log panel has buttons for clearing the log and for saving it
to a file.  However, it is likely that your browser will not permit you
to save the log.  Unfortunately, the applet has no provision for
printing the log at this time.  You might try using copy-and-paste to
copy the data from the log to another program from which you can copy
or print it.</p>
