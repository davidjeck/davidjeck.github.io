         Multiprocessing</font></H2>

<hr alignt=center width="50%">

<p><font size="+2">A </font>CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT EXECUTES A PROGRAM one step at a time,
fetching each instruction from memory and executing it before going
on to the next instruction.  In many cases, though, a problem can
be broken down into sub-problems that could be solved at the same
time.  In <font color="#E70000">parallel processing</font>, several CPUs work simultaneously
on a problem, each one solving a different sub-problem.  This is one
of the major techniques for speeding up the execution of programs.</p>

<p>Even when only one processor is available, it is sometimes natural to
break down a program into parts that can be executed simultaneously.
<font color="#eE70000">Multitasking</font> can be applied to divide the single processor's
time among the various parts of the program.  The program won't
be executed any more quickly, but the use of parallel processing
&quot;abstractions&quot; might make the program easier to write.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will use the multitasking capabilities of the
xTurtle programming language.  In this language, it is possible
to split (or <font color="#e70000">fork</font>) a process into several processes that
will all execute simultaneously and independently.  Each process will
have its own turtle visible on the screen, so you can actually see
what is going on.  Although you will be seeing only simulated
parallel processing, it would be at least theoretically possible for
each process to run on its own CPU.</p>

<p>The background material for this lab is covered in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of 
<cite><a href="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The Most Complex Machine</a></cite>.
It would be useful, but not essential, for you to read that material before working
on the lab.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="mult">Multiple Turtles</A></font></H3>

<p>After launching xTurtle, select the first sample program,
&quot;Bugs.txt,&quot; from the pop-up menu at the top of the
xTurtle window.  Run the program by clicking on the &quot;Run
Program&quot; button.  You will
see ten turtles wandering around on the screen.  This is a very
simple program, but it illustrates the basic multiprocessing
command in xTurtle, the <font color="#007000">fork</font> statement.</p>

<p>The statement <tt>fork(10)</tt> causes a single process to split into
ten processes.  Any commands in the program that follow the fork
statement will be executed by each process independently and
simultaneously.  In the Bugs program,
each of the ten processes goes into a loop that sends
its turtle on a random walk, and so you see all ten
turtles wandering aimlessly on the screen.  Each turtle
follows the same program, but each turtle chooses different
random numbers and so each turtle follows its own random
path.  The first two exercises at the end of the lab ask
you to add a few modifications to this program.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">


<p>When a process is forked, all of the processes that are created
start out in exactly the same state, with one small exception.
The xTurtle language has a predefined variable named <font color="#007000">ForkNumber</font>.
This is a read-only variable; that is, you can test the value
of this variable but you can't change its value.  Each of the
processes created by a <font color="#007000">fork</font> statement gets its own value
for <font color="#007000">ForkNumber</font>.  For the first process, the value of
<font color="#007000">ForkNumber</font> is 1, for the second the value is 2, and so forth.
To test this, try executing the following commands.  Type them
on a single line in the input box at the bottom of the xTurtle window,
and then click the &quot;Do It&quot; button:</p>

<p align=center><tt>fork(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;TellUser(&quot;ForkNumber = #ForkNumber&quot;)</tt></p>

<p>When the computer executes the TellUser command, it substitutes the
actual value of ForkNumber for &quot;<tt>#ForkNumber</tt>&quot;.
Make sure you understand what happens.  (You have to type both
commands in the input box on one line.  If you execute ``<tt>fork(5)</tt>''
by itself, two processes will be created, but both processes will
&quot;die&quot; before you get a chance to type in the next command.)
</p>

<p>In the sample program &quot;ParallelSpectrum.txt&quot;, the 
ForkNumber is used in the program in several calculations.  Each 
process does the same calculation, but since different processes
have different values for ForkNumber, the result will be different
in each process.  For example, &quot;<tt>turn(4*ForkNumber)</tt>&quot;
will make Turtle #1 turn 4 degrees, Turtle #2 turn 8 degrees,
Turtle #3 turn 12 degrees, and so on.</p>


<p>The sample program &quot;TwoTasks.txt&quot; shows how ForkNumber
can be used to make several turtles do several completely different
tasks.  When you run this program, two processes are created with
a <font color="#007000">fork</font> command.  Both processes execute
an IF statement of the form:</p>

<pre>                   IF  ForkNumber = 1  THEN
                      { do one thing }
                   ELSE
                      { do something else }
                   END IF
</pre>

<p>The first turtle, with a ForkNumber of 1, does one task
while the second turtle, with a ForkNumber of 2,
does another, completely different task.
You are asked to do something similar in Exercise 3 at the end of 
the lab.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p>Two other sample programs, &quot;ParallelSnowflake.txt&quot;
and &quot;Circles.txt,&quot; show that a program can contain
more than one <font color="#007000">fork</font> command.
In these programs, the first <font color="#007000">fork</font>
command creates several processes.  Each of these processes
then goes on to execute a second <font color="#007000">fork</font>
command.  When this happens, <b>each</b> process splits into
several processes.  You can see this clearly when you run
&quot;ParallelSnowflake.txt,&quot; which creates 216 processes
with a sequence of three <tt>fork(6)</tt> commands.</p>

<p>The &quot;Circles.txt&quot; sample program illustrates another
important fact.  It shows how a <font color="#007000">declare</font>
statement works when it occurs after a <font colot="#007000">fork</font>.
Every process will execute the <font color="#007000">declare</font>
statement separately, so that every process will have its <b>own</b>
copy of the variable.  Thus, the variable can be assigned different values
in different processes.  You will need to understand the
&quot;Circles.txt&quot; program in order to do exercise 4
at the end of the lab.</p>

<p>On a <a href="xTurtleTilingExamples.html">separate web page</a>,
I've provided a set of six sample programs that use xTurtle multitasking
to draw some interesting &quot;tilings&quot; of the plane.  These
are pictures that would be more difficult to draw without multitasking.
If you like pretty pictures, you might want to take a look.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="sched">Scheduling</A></font></H3>

<p>The operating system of a multitasking computer
is in charge of <font color="#E70000">scheduling</font> all
the processes.  That is, it determines which process gets to run next and
how long it will be permitted to run.  The CPU, under the control of the
operating system, will execute one process for a while, then switch to
another, then to another, and so forth.  In xTurtle,
the scheduling is done by the xTurtle applet, but the objective
is to simulate the way things are done in an actual multitasking
computer system.</p>

<p>When you watch the execution of the &quot;ParallelSnowflake.txt&quot;
or &quot;Circles.txt&quot; sample program, you'll see that the processes
do not all run at exactly the same speed.  As the system switches its attention
from one process to another, there is some randomness in the amount of
time that is spent on each process.  The xTurtle program
is set up to run this way by default, since it's the way real multitasking
systems work.</p>

<p>However, the xTurtle applet has an option to run all the processes
at exactly the same rate of speed.  To turn this option on, click
on the &quot;Lock Step&quot; checkbox in the bottom right corner of
the xTurtle window.  When this box is checked, all the turtles on
the screen will move in &quot;lock step.&quot;  While this might not
be an accurate simulation of multitasking, it can be pretty to watch.
You might want to try executing some of the sample programs with
this option turned on.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="shared">Shared Variables</A></font></H3>

<p>In all the examples you have seen so far, the multiple processes are
completely independent.  The various turtles go about their business without
interacting with the other turtles in any way.  (This is not quite true,
since the turtles have to share the same screen.  You might have noticed
that one turtle will sometimes wipe out the image of another turtle
temporarily.)</p>

<p>Things can get more interesting when the processes have to communicate
with each other.  In xTurtle, processes communicate through <font color="#e70000">shared
variables</font>.  When a variable is declared <b>before</b> a <font color="#007000">fork</font>
command, there is only <b>one</b> copy of that variable, which is shared by
all the processes.  If any of those processes changes the value of the
variable, then all the other processes can see the new value.  This is the
only form of communication between processes that can occur in xTurtle.</p>

<p>As explained in <cite>The Most Complex Machine,</cite>
great care must be taken when shared variables
are used for communication, so that one process does not change the value
of a variable while another process is using that value.  A process must
obtain exclusive access to a shared variable while it is using that
variable.  This is the <font color="#e70000">mutual exclusion</font> problem.
In xTurtle, the <font color="#007000">grab</font>
statement is provided to make mutual exclusion possible.
A <font color="#007000">grab</font> statement takes the form</p>

<pre>                   GRAB &lt;global variable name&gt; THEN
                      &lt;statements&gt;
                   END GRAB
</pre>

<p>Only one process at a time is allowed to &quot;grab&quot; a given variable.
When a process comes to a <font color="#007000">grab</font>
statement, the computer checks
to see whether another process has already grabbed the variable.
If so, then the second process must wait until the first process
releases its lock on the variable by finishing the execution
of its <font color="#007000">grab</font> statement.
Only then is the second process allowed to grab the variable and
execute the statements in its own <font color="#007000">grab</font>
statement.
(Of course, this can cause big problems if a process grabs a
variable and doesn't release it.  Other processes that want
to grab the variable will never get a chance to run at all.)</p>

<p>The statements inside a <font color="#007000">grab</font>
statement are called a <font color="#e70000">critical
region</font>.  As long as access to shared variables is confined to
critical regions, processes can use the variables to communicate in
relative safety.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p>Even with the grab statement, communication among processes
can still be very complicated.  A relatively straightforward
example can be found in the sample program &quot;SynchronizedRandomWalk.txt.&quot;
Select this program from the pop-up menu, read the comments, and run the program.
You will see two turtles executing identical random walks.
One of the turtles selects a random angle to be used in the random
walk and records it in the shared variable, <tt>angle</tt>.  The other
turtle reads the value from the shared variable and uses it.
A second shared variable, <tt>control</tt>, is used in a <font color="#007000">grab</font>
statement to control access to <tt>angle</tt>.  Exercise 6 asks you
to modify this program so that more than two processes are
involved.</p>

<p>Another example of shared variables is given in the sample program
&quot;ThreeNPlusOneMax.txt.&quot;
Read the comments in the program and run the program.  It will take
a few seconds to run, and you won't see anything happening until the
end, when the program reports the value that it has computed.
In Exercise 7, you will work with a similar example.</p></p>

<p>The ThreeNPlusOneMax program also illustrates what happens when a <font color="#007000">fork</font>
command is used inside a subroutine:  At the end of the subroutine,
all the processes are &quot;rejoined&quot; into one process before the subroutine
terminates.  After the subroutine finishes, there is only
one process to carry on.  The forking is part of the subroutine's black box;
it has no effect outside the subroutine.  In the sample program, there is only
one process to execute the TellUser statement at the end of the program.</p>



<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="exercises">Exercises</A></font></H3>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>
Modify the sample program &quot;Bugs.txt&quot; so that each
bug will leave a trail behind it as it wanders randomly
around on the screen.  Each of the trails should be a
different color.  The screen should look something like
this after the program has run for a while:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/xTurtle10.gif" alt="Bugs with trails" width="204" height="181"></p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>
In the sample program &quot;Bugs,&quot; ten &quot;bugs&quot; wander around on the
screen.  Real bugs, though, are born and die.  Add &quot;birth&quot; and 
&quot;death&quot; to the Bugs program.  Add birth by programming 
a one-in-twenty-five chance that a bug will split in two, each time
it moves.  (You can program a one-in-twenty-five chance by checking
whether RandomInt(25) is 1.) Similarly, there should be a 1-in-25 chance
that the bug will die.</p>
<p>To program death, you will need to know about another built-in xTurtle command,
<font color="#007000">KillProcess</font>.  When a process executes
the command <font color="#007000">KillProcess</font>, it dies.
The turtle for that process disappears from the screen. (Note that
this command differs from <font color="#007000">Halt</font>.  If
any process executes a <font color="#007000">Halt</font> command,
the entire program halts and so <b>all</b> the turtles die.)</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>
The sample program &quot;TwoGraphs.txt&quot;
draws the graphs of two functions, one after the other.
Instead of a single turtle that draws the graphs one
after the other, the program could use two turtles
that draw the graphs at the same time. 
Modify the program so that it does this.
You only need to do a bit of work on the half-dozen
or so lines at the very bottom of the program.</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
Write a program that uses two <font color="#007000">fork(9)</font>
statements to draw a multiplication table like this one on
the screen:</p>

<pre>               1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
               2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18
               3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27
               4   8  12  16  20  24  28  32  36
               5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45
               6  12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54
               7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63
               8  16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72
               9  18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81
</pre>

<p>The entry in row number <i>row</i> and column number <i>col</i>
is <i>row*col</i>.  Your program will be similar in outline to the
sample program, &quot;Circles.txt.&quot;  You'll need to use
the <font color="#007000">DrawText</font> command to write 
each number on the screen.  Recall that if <i>num</i> is a variable,
then the command <font color="#007000">DrawText(&quot;#num&quot;)</font>
will output the value of <i>num</i> at the current turtle position.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font> A recursive subroutine
for drawing binary trees was covered in <a href="xTurtleLab3.html">xTurtle Lab 3</a>.
Binary trees can also be drawn using multitasking.  Each &quot;fork&quot;
in the tree is represented by a <font color="#E70000">fork</font> command
in the program.  Here is a recursive subroutine that uses multitasking to
draw a binary tree:</p>

<pre>            SUB tree(size, complexity)
               IF complexity &gt; 0 THEN
                  forward( size/2 )
                  fork( 2 )
                  IF ForkNumber = 1 THEN
                     turn( 45 )
                  ELSE
                     turn( -45 )
                  END IF
                  tree( size/2, complexity - 1 )
               END IF
            END SUB
</pre>

<p>Implement this subroutine in a program that draws binary trees.
Then modify the subroutine to add some color and an element
of randomness.  For example, instead of being always equal to two,
the number of branches could be random.  Instead of just dividing the
size by 2, you could multiply it by a random amount. Try to make
your program draw &quot;bushes&quot; that bear at least some resemblance
to real bushes.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
Modify the sample program &quot;SynchronizedRandomWalk.txt&quot;
so that instead of showing two turtles moving in identical
random walks, it shows <i>five</i> turtles moving in identical
random walks.  Each of the turtles should start from a different
position and should draw in a different color.  The hard part of
this exercise is passing off the &quot;control&quot; from one turtle
to the next.  You have to make sure that the <i>control</i> goes
through the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then back to 1 so that each
turtle will get a chance to move.  Just as in the original program,
Turtle #1 should select the random angle.  Each of the other four
turtles should use the same angle.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>
The Sample program &quot;SumOfSquares.txt&quot;
is a <b>failed</b> attempt to write a program that computes the value
of the sum</p>

<p align=center>1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + ... + 25<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Run the program several times.  It will give a different answer
each time.  (If you've turned on the &quot;Lock Step&quot; checkbox,
then you'll get the same answer each time, but it will still be an
incorrect answer.)
Use a <font color="#007000">grab</font> statement to fix the program so
that it gives the correct answer.  See the &quot;ThreeNPlusOneMax.txt&quot;
sample program for an example of using a <font color="#007000">grab</font>
statement for a similar purpose.
Write a short essay explaining carefully what
goes wrong when the <font color="#007000">grab</font> statement is omitted
and how adding the <font color="#007000">grab</font> statement fixes the problem.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font>  Design your own
parallel processing xTurtle program.  Try to make a nice colorful
design, either random or symmetric.  Hopefully, it will be fun to
watch as multiple turtles construct the picture.
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font>  
Is it really sometimes easier to write a program using parallel processing
than to write a standard program to do the same task?  Write a short essay
explaining and defending your opinion.</p>
