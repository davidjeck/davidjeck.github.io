<p><font size="+2">I</font>T IS POSSIBLE IN THEORY to construct a computer
entirely out of transistors (although in practice, other types of basic
components are also used).  Of course, in the process of assembling a computer,
individual transistors are first assembled into relatively simple
circuits, which are then assembled into more complex circuits, and so
on.  The first step in this process is to build <font color="#E70000">logic gates</font>,
which are circuits that compute basic logical operations such as <font color="#E70000">AND</font>,
<font color="#E70000">OR</font>, and <font color="#E70000">NOT</font>.
In fact, once AND, OR, and NOT gates are available, a 
computer could be assembled entirely from such gates.
In this lab you will work with simulated circuits made up of AND, OR and
NOT gates.  You will be able to build such circuits and see how they
operate.  And you will see how simpler circuits can be combined to
produce more complex circuits.</p>

<p>This lab covers some of the same material as Chapter 2
in <cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>.
The lab is self-contained, but many of the ideas covered here are covered
in more depth in the text, and it would be useful for you to read
Chapter 2 before doing the lab.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="logic">Logic and Circuits</A></font></H3>

<p>A logic gate is a simple circuit with one or two inputs and one
output.  The inputs and outputs can be either ON or OFF,
and the value of a gate's output is completely determined by the values
of its inputs (with the proviso that when one of the inputs is changed,
it takes some small amount of time for the output to change in
response). Each gate does a simple computation.  Circuits that do
complex computations can be built by connecting outputs of some gates
to inputs of others.  In fact, an entire computer can be built in
this way.</p>

<p>In the xLogicCircuits applet, circuits are constructed from AND gates,
OR gates, and NOT gates.  Each type of gate has a different rule for computing
its output value.  Circuits are laid out on a <font color="#E70000">circuit
board</font>.  Besides gates, the circuit board can contain <font color="#E70000">Inputs</font>,
<font color="#E70000">Outputs</font>, and <font color="#E70000">Tacks</font>.
Later, we'll see that circuits can also contain other circuits.  All these
components can be interconnected by wires.  To the left of the circuit board in the applet
is a <font color="#E70000">pallette</font>.  The pallette contains components available
to be used on the circuit board.  You can't usually see all the components at once,
but there is a scroll bar that allows you to scroll through all the components on the
pallette.   <A NAME="illustration">The following illustration</A> shows the part
of the pallette that contains
the six standard components, along with some comments and a small sample circuit:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic1.gif" 
        ALT="The standard component pallette" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="461"></p>
        
<p>(One thing you should note: Wires cannot connect to each other except at
Tacks.  Just because two wires cross each other on the circuit board does not
mean that they are connected.  That is, no signal will propagate from one
of the wires to another.  Wires can only carry signals between components
such as gates, Tacks, Inputs, and Outputs.)</p>

<p>The applet that you launched <A HREF="#launch">above</A> should start
up showing a sample circuit called &quot;Basic Gates.&quot;  At the top of the
circuit board are an AND gate, an OR gate, and a NOT gate.  The gates are
connected to some Inputs and Outputs.  A more complicated circuit built
from several gates occupies the bottom of the circuit board.</p>

<p>To see how the circuit works, you have to turn on the <font color="#E70000">power</font>.
Power to the circuit board is turned on and off using the &quot;Power&quot;
checkbox below the circuit board.  The power is ON when the box is checked.
<b>Click on the Power checkbox now to turn
on the power.</b>  (Why does the wire leading from the NOT gate come on when
you do this?)  When the power is on, you have control over the Inputs on
the circuit board: you can turn an input ON and OFF by clicking on it.
The circuit does the rest: signals from the Inputs propagate along wires,
through gates and other components, and to the Outputs of the circuit.
<b>Try it</b> with the sample circuit.  If you have a problem, make sure the
power is on and that you are clicking on an Input, not an Output.</p>

<p>You should check that the AND, OR, and NOT gates at the top of the
circuit board have the expected behavior when you turn their inputs ON
and OFF.  You can also investigate the circuit in the bottom half of the
logic board.  Below the circuit board, to the left of the Power switch,
you'll find a <font color="#E70000">pop-up menu</font> that can be used to
control the speed at which signals propagate through the circuit.  The
speed is ordinarily set to &quot;Fast.&quot;  You can use the pop-up
menu to change the speed to &quot;Moderate&quot; or &quot;Slow&quot;
if you want to watch the circuit in slow motion.  (For the most part,
though, you probably want to leave the speed set to Fast.)</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>Logic gates and logic circuits are associated with mathematical
<font color="#E70000">logic</font>, which is the study of the computations
that can be done with the <font color="#E70000">logical values</font>
<b>true</b> and <b>false</b> and with
the logical <font color="#E70000">operators</font>
<b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, and <b>not</b>.  This association
comes about when we think of ON as representing <b>true</b> and OFF
as representing <b>false</b>.  In that case, AND, OR, and NOT gates do the
same computations as the operators <b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, and <b>not</b>.</p>

<p>Mathematical logic uses <font color="#E70000">Boolean algebra</font>,
in which the letters A, B, C, and so on, are used to represent logical
values.  Letters are combined using the logical operators <b>and</b>,
<b>or</b>, and <b>not</b>.  For example,<p>

<p align=center>(A <b>and</b> C) <b>or</b>
      (B <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> C))</p>

<p>is an expression of Boolean algebra.  As soon as the letters in an
expression are assigned values <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, the value of
the entire expression can be computed.</p>

<p>Every expression of boolean algebra corresponds to a logic circuit.
The letters used in the expression are represented by the Inputs to
the circuit.  Each wire in the circuit represents some part of
the expression.  A gate takes the values from its input wires and combines
them with the appropriate word -- <b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, or <b>not</b> -- to
produce the label on its output wire.  The final output of the whole
circuit represents the expression as a whole.  <A NAME="xor">For example</A>, consider
the sample circuit from the applet.  If the inputs are labeled A and B,
then the wires in the circuit can be labeled as follows:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic2.gif" ALT="Circuit labeled with logical expressions" WIDTH="471" HEIGHT="116"></p>

<p>The circuit as a whole corresponds to the final output expression,
(A <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> B)) <b>or</b> (B <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> A)).
This expression in turn serves as a <font color="#E70000">blueprint</font>
for the circuit.  You can use it as a guide for building the circuit.
The expression given earlier, (A <b>and</b> C) <b>or</b> (B <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> C)),
corresponds to another sample circuit shown in the illustration <A HREF="#illustration">above</A>
-- provided you label the inputs appropriately.</p>

<p>To sum up, given any expression of Boolean algebra, a circuit can be built to
compute that expression.  Conversely, any output of a logic circuit that does not
contain a &quot;feedback loop&quot; can be described by a Boolean algebra expression.
This is a powerful association that is useful in understanding and designing logic
circuits.  (Note:  Feedback occurs when the output of a gate is connected through
one or more other components back to an input of the same gate.  Circuits with
feedback are not covered in this lab.  However, they have important uses
that are covered in the <A HREF="xLogicCircuitsLab2.html">next lab</A>.)

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="building">Building Circuits</A></font></H3>

<p>You can build your own circuits in the xLogicCircuits applet.  Click on
the &quot;Iconify&quot; button at the bottom of the applet.  This will
put away the &quot;Basic Gates&quot; circuit, by turning it into an icon
on the pallette.  You'll have a clear circuit board to work on.
As an exercise, try to make a copy of the sample circuit shown
<A HREF="#illustration">above</A>, which corresponds to the Boolean
expression</p>

<p align=center>(A <b>and</b> C) <b>or</b>
                  (B <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> C)).</p>
                  
<p>To add a component to your circuit, click on the component in the pallette,
hold down the mouse button, and use the mouse to drag the component onto
the circuit board.  Make sure you drag it completely onto the board.  If you
want a gate that is facing in a different direction, you have to rotate the 
gate in the pallette <b>before</b> you drag it onto the circuit board.</p>

<p>Once some components are on the board, you can draw wires between them
using the mouse.  Every wire goes from a <font color="#E70000">source</font>
to a <font color="#E70000">destination</font>.  To draw a wire, move the
mouse over the source, click and hold the mouse button, move the mouse
to the destination, and release the button.  You <b>must</b> draw the
wire from source to destination, not the reverse.  If you release the mouse
button when the wire is not over a legal destination, no wire will be drawn.
When there are two possible destinations in one component -- such as the two
inputs of an AND or OR gate -- make sure that you get the wire connected
to the right one.</p>

<p>Circuit Inputs are valid sources for wires.  So are Tacks.  So are
the <b>outputs</b> of gates.  Valid destinations include circuit Outputs,
inputs of gates, and Tacks.  You can draw as many wires as you want
<b>from</b> a source, but you can only draw <b>one</b> wire to a
destination.  (This makes sense because when the circuit is running,
a destination takes its value from the single wire that leads to it.
On the other hand, the value of a source can be sent to any number of
wires that lead from it.)</p>

<p>Once a component is on the board, you can still move it to a new
position, but you have to <b>drag it using the right mouse button</b>.
Alternatively -- if you have a one-button mouse, for example -- you can
drag a component by <b>holding down the control key</b> as you first press
the mouse button on it.</p>

<p>You can <b>delete</b> components and wires that you've added by mistake.
Just click on the component or wire to <font color="#E70000">hilite</font> it.
Then click on the &quot;Delete&quot; button at the bottom of the applet.
The hilited item will be deleted from the circuit board.  If you delete
a component that has wires attached, the attached wires will also be deleted
along with the component.</p>

<p>If you delete an item or modify the circuit in some other way, you get
one chance to change your mind.  You can click on the &quot;Undo&quot;
button to undo one operation.  Only the most recent operation can be
undone in this way.</p>

<p>There is one shortcut that you might find useful, if you like using Tacks.
You can insert a Tack into an existing wire by double-clicking on the wire. If you
double-click and hold the mouse down on the second click, you can drag the tack
to a different position.  (However, some browsers might not support double-clicks.)</p>

<p>After you build the practice circuit, you can clear the screen, since you
won't need that circuit again in the rest of the lab.  However, you'll get
more practice building circuits in the Exercises at the end of the lab.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="subcircuits">Complex Circuits and Subcircuits</A></font></H3>

<p>In order to have circuits that display <font color="#E70000">structured complexity</font>,
it is important to be able to build on previous work when designing
new circuits.  Once a circuit has been designed and saved, it should
be possible to use that circuit as a component in a more complex
circuit.  A lot of the power of xLogicCircuits comes from the ability to use
circuits as components in other circuits.  Circuits used in this way are
called <font color="#E70000">subcircuits</font>.  A circuit that has
been saved as an icon in the pallette can simply be dragged into another
circuit.  (More exactly, a <b>copy</b> of the circuit is created and is
added to the circuit board.  The copy is a separate circuit; editing the original
will not change the copy.)  This ability to build on previous work is
essential for creating complex circuits.</p>

<p>You can open a circuit from the pallette to see what's inside or to edit
it.  Just click on the icon to hilite it, and then click on the &quot;Enlarge&quot;
button.  The icon will be removed from the pallette and the circuit will appear
on the circuit board.  At the same time, any circuit that was previously on
the circuit board will be iconified and placed on the pallette.  
You should also be able to enlarge a circuit just by double-clicking on it.
(By the way, you can change the name of the circuit on the
circuit board by editing the 
text-input box at the top of the applet.  This box contains the name that
appears on the iconified circuit.)</p>

<p>The xLogicCircuits applet should have loaded several subcircuits for the
pallette.  One of these circuits is called &quot;Two or More&quot;.  <b>Open
this circut now.</b>
The circuit has three inputs.  It turns its output ON whenever at least
two of its inputs are ON.  Try it.  (Click on the inputs to turn them ON
and OFF -- and don't forget to turn the Power on first.)</p>

<p>As a simple exercise in building circuits from subcircuits, use
the &quot;Two or More&quot; circuit as part of a &quot;At Most One&quot;
circuit.  You want to build a circuit with three inputs that will turn on
its output whenever zero or one of its inputs is on.  Notice that this is
just the opposite behavior from the &quot;Two or More&quot; circuit.  That is,
&quot;At Most One&quot; is ON whenever &quot;Two or More&quot; is <b>not</b>
ON.  This &quot;logical&quot; description shows that the &quot;At Most One&quot;
circuit can be built from a NOT gate and a copy of the &quot;Two or More&quot;
circuit.  Begin by re-Iconifying the &quot;Two or More&quot; circuit,
then drag a NOT gate and a copy of &quot;Two or More&quot; onto the empty
circuit board.  Add Inputs, Outputs, and
wires as appropriate, then test your circuit to make
sure that it works.  If you like, you can give it a name and turn it into
an icon.</p>

<p>Next, open the &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; sample circuit.  You'll see that
it contains several copies of a subcircuit called &quot;Adder.&quot;
It's possible to look inside one of these circuits:  Just click on the
adder circuit to hilite it, and then click the &quot;Enlarge&quot;
button. This does <b>not</b> remove the
main circuit from the board -- it just lets you see an enlarged part of
it.  When you shrink the subcircuit back down to its original size, the
main circuit is still there. In this case, you'll see that an &quot;Adder&quot;
circuit contains two &quot;Half Adder&quot; subcircuits, which you can
enlarge in their turn, if you want.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="arithmetic">Circuits and Arithmetic</A></font></H3>

<p>The &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; circuit is an example of a logic circuit
that can work with binary numbers.  Circuits can work with binary numbers
as soon as you think of ON as representing the binary value 1 (one) and OFF
as representing the value 0 (zero).  The &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; can add 
two 4-bit binary numbers to give a five digit result.  Here are some
examples of adding 4-bit binary numbers:</p>

<pre>
      1011       1111       1111       1010       0111       0001
      0110       0001       1111       0101       1010       0011
     -----      -----      -----      -----      -----      -----
     10001      10000      11110      01111      10001      00100

</pre>

<p>The answer has 5 bits because there can be a <font color="#E70000">carry</font>
from the left-most column.  Each of the four &quot;Adder&quot; circuits
in the &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; handles one of the columns in the sum.
You should test the &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; to see that it gets the right
answers for the above sums.  
The two four-bit numbers that are to be added are put on the eight
Inputs at the top of &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot;.  The sum appears on the
outputs at the bottom, with the fifth bit -- the final carry -- appearing
on the output on the right.  You should observe that it takes some time
after you set the inputs for the circuits to perform its computations.</p>



<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="exercises">Exercises</A></font></H3>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>  One of the examples in this
lab was the circuit corresponding to the expression</p>
<p align=center>(A <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> B)) <b>or</b> (B <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> A)).</p>
<p>This circuit is ON if <b>exactly one</b> of its inputs is on.  Another way
to describe the output is to say that it is ON if &quot;one or the other
of the inputs is on, but not both of the inputs are on.&quot; This description
corresponds to the Boolean expression</p>
<p align=center>(A <b>or</b> B) <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> ((A <b>and</b> B)).</p>

<p>Build a circuit corresponding to the second expression, and check that
it gives the same output as the first circuit for every possible combination
of inputs.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>
When you checked &quot;every possible combination of inputs&quot; for
the circuit in Exercise 1, how many combinations did you have to check?
If you wanted to check that the &quot;Two or More&quot; example circuit
works correctly for every possible combination of inputs, how many combinations
would you have to check? Why?  If you wanted to check that the 
&quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; gives the correct answer for each possible set of inputs,
how many inputs are there to check?  Why?</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>Consider the following
three Boolean algebra expressions:</p>

<p align=center>
(A <B>and</B> B <B>and</B> C) <B>or</B> (<B>not</B> B)
</p>
<p align=center>
(<B>not</B> ((<B>not</B> A) <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> B)))
<p align=center>
(<B>not</B> (A <B>or</B> B)) <B>or</B> (A <B>and</B> B)
</p>

<p>For each expression, build a logic circuit that computes the value of
that expression.  Write a paragraph that explains the method that you
apply when you build circuits from expressions.  (One note:  To build a circuit
for an expression of the form (X <b>and</b> Y <b>and</b> Z), you should insert
some extra parentheses, which don't change the answer.  Think of the
expression as ((X <b>and</b> Y) <b>and</b> Z), and build the circuit using two
AND gates.)</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
Given a logic circuit that does not contain any feedback loops, it
is possible to find a Boolean algebra expression that describes each 
output of that circuit.  Open the circuit called &quot;For Ex. 4&quot;,
which was one of the sample circuits in the applet's pallette.
This circuit has four inputs and three outputs.  Assuming that the inputs
are called A, B, C, and D, find the expression that corresponds to each
of the three outputs.  Also write a paragraph that discusses the
procedure that you apply to find the Boolean expression for the
output of a circuit.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>
Consider the following input/output table for a circuit with two inputs and
one output.  The table gives the desired output of the circuit for each
possible combination of inputs.</p>


<center>
<TABLE border=1>

<TR align=center>
	<TD><B>&nbsp;Input 1&nbsp;</B></TD>	<TD><B>&nbsp;Input 2&nbsp;</B></TD>	
	                                <TD><B>&nbsp;Output&nbsp;</B></TD>

</TR>
<TR align=center>
	<TD>OFF</TD>	<TD>OFF</TD>	<TD>ON</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</center>

<p>Construct a circuit that displays the specified behavior.  You have to 
build <b>one</b> circuit that satisfies <b>all four</b> rows of the table.
Section 2.1 of <cite>The Most Complex Machines</cite> gives a general 
method for constructing a circuit specified by an input/output table.
You can apply that method, or you can just try to reason logically about
what the table says.  Write a paragraph discussing how you found your
circuit.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
One of the examples in this lab was a circuit called &quot;Two or More&quot;,
which checks whether at least two of its inputs are on.  Consider the
problem of finding a similar circuit with four inputs.  The output should
be on if any two (or more) of the inputs are on.  A circuit that does
this can be described by the Boolean expression:</p>

<p align=center>(A <B>and</B> (B <B>or</B> C <B>or</B> D))
<B>or</B> (B <B>and</B> (C <B>or</B> D))
<B>or</B> (C <B>and</B> D)</p>

<p>Use this expression to construct a &quot;Two or More&quot;
circuit with four inputs.  Try to understand where this expression comes
from.  Why does it make sense?  (Hint: Think of two cases, one case where
the input A is ON, and the other case where the input A is OFF.)
Write a paragraph explaining this.  The form of this expression
can be extended to handle circuits with any number of inputs.
Write down a logical expression that describes a circuit with <b>five</b>
inputs that turns on its output whenever two or more of the inputs are on.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>
&quot;The structure of the 4-Bit Adder circuit reflects the structure
of the compution it is designed to perform.&quot;  In what sense is this
true?  What does it mean?  How does this relate to problem-solving in general?
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font>
Write a short essay (of several paragraphs) that explains
how subcircuits are used in the construction of complex circuits and
why the ability to make and use subcircuits in this way is so important.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font>
Build a &quot;Select&quot; circuit, as shown in this illustration:
</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic4.gif" ALT="Select Circuit" WIDTH="314" HEIGHT="100"></p>

<p>The circuit has two inputs, A and B, at the top.  It also has two inputs,
C and D, on the left, which serve as <font color="#E70000">control wires</font>.
(The only thing that makes an input of a circuit a control wire is that
the designer of the circuit says it is, but in general control wires are
thought of as controlling the circuit in some way.)  The control wires
determine which of the inputs, A or B, gets to the output.
In order to do this exercise, you should think &quot;logically.&quot;
That is, try to describe the output of the circuit using a Boolean 
expression involving A, B, C, and D.  Then use that expression as a blueprint
for the circuit.  <b>Test your circuit</b> and save it for use
in Exercise 10.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 10:</b></font>
For this exercise, you should build a &quot;Mini ALU&quot; that can do
either addition or subtraction of four-bit binary numbers.  An
<font color="#E70000">Arithmetic Logic Unit</font>, or ALU, is the
part of a computer that does the basic arithmetic and logical computations.
It takes two binary numbers and computes some output.  The interesting
thing is that an ALU can perform several different operations.  It
has control wires to tell it which operation to perform.  You will
build an ALU that can perform either addition or subtraction of
four-bit binary numbers.  It has two control wires.  Turning on 
one of these will make it do an addition; turning on the other will
make it do a subtraction.  You should construct the circuit as specified
by this illustration:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic5.gif" ALT="Mini ALU" WIDTH="480" HEIGHT="206"></p>

<p>Now, an interesting thing about an ALU is that it actually performs all
the computations that it knows how to do.  The control wires just
control which of the answers get to the outputs of the ALU.  To make
your &quot;Mini ALU,&quot; you can start with the &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot;
and &quot;4-Bit Minus&quot; circuits, which were provided to you
in the applet's palette.  (The four-bit subtraction circuit has only
four outputs, since for subtraction the carry bit from the leftmost
adder does not provide any useful information. You don't have to worry about how the Minus
circuit works -- you don't even have to understand how negative numbers
are represented in binary.)</p>

<p>Start by placing a &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; and a &quot;4-Bit Minus&quot; circuit
on an empty circuit board, along with the eight inputs at the top of the
circuit.  These can be connected as shown:</p>

<p>(Note: To change the size and shape of a subcircuit, click the circuit to hilite it.
When a circuit is hilited, it is surrounded by a rectangle with a little
square handle in each corner.  You can click-and-drag one of these
handles to adjust the size of the circuit.)</p>

<p>All you have to do is construct the rest of the circuit so that the
control wires can control whether the answer from the &quot;4-Bit Adder&quot;
or the answer from the &quot;4-Bit Minus&quot; gets through to the Outputs
of the ALU.  One way to do this is to use four copies of the &quot;Select&quot;
circuit that you built for Exercise 9.</p>
