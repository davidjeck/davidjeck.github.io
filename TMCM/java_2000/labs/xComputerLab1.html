         Introduction to xComputer</font></H2>

<hr alignt=center width="50%">

<p><font size="+1">T</font>HIS LAB INTRODUCES the
xComputer applet, which simulates
a simple model computer (which is also called xComputer).
The model computer is discussed in Chapter 3 of <cite>The Most
Complex Machine</cite>.  The xComputer consists of a
<font color="#E70000">Central Processing
Unit</font> (CPU) and a <font color="#E70000">main memory</font>
that holds 1024 sixteen-bit binary numbers. The CPU contains
an <font color="#E70000">Arithmetic-Logic Unit</font> (ALU)
for performing basic arithmetic and logical computations.
It also contains eight <font color="#E70000">registers</font>,
which hold binary numbers that are being used
directly in the CPU's computations, a
<font color="#E70000">Control circuit</font>, which is
responsible for supervising the computations that the CPU performs, 
and a <font color="#E70000">clock</font>, which drives
the whole operation of the computer by turning its single
output wire on and off.</p>

<p>The xComputer applet that you will use in this lab lets you
load programs and data into the memory of the
simulated xComputer.  You can 
then watch while those programs are executed,
and you can observe how numbers stored in the computer
change as a program runs. The applet displays only the registers
and main memory.  You have to take the control circuit, ALU,
and clock on faith.</p>

<p>This lab contains basic information about xComputer
and its machine language.
It demonstrates how instructions are fetched
from memory and executed by the CPU.  It will also
explain the features of the xComputer applet and the
process of programming the xComputer.
The <A HREF="xComputerLab2.html">next lab</A> will cover
the programming process in more detail.</p>

<p>You would find it useful to read through Chapter 3 of
the text before doing this lab.  Chapter 3 is rather
technical, and you might find that you need to work
through both this lab and that chapter before you really
understand either of them.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="applet">The xComputer Applet</A></font></H3>

<p>The xComputer applet is divided into three sections.  The
right-hand third of the applet represents the main memory
of the simulated computer. This section of the applet shows the
1024 locations in xComputer's memory.  These locations
are numbered from 0 to 1023. Each line in the memory
shows a location number (in blue) and the value stored in that
location.  When the program first starts up, the memory
contains only zeros. The scroll bar can be used to view
any part of memory.</p>

<p>The &quot;Control&quot; section of the applet is used to
interact with and control the xComputer.  For example, you
can use text-input boxes and buttons in the Control section to
enter programs and data into the xComputer's memory.
Once a program has been loaded into memory, you can tell
the xComputer to execute it.  You'll learn about controlling
the xComputer as you work through the lab.</p>

<p>The &quot;Registers&quot; section of the applet
shows the xComputer's eight registers. Remember that
a <font color="#E70000">register</font> is simply a
memory unit in the CPU that holds data being used
directly in the CPU's computations. Each register plays a
particular role in the execution of programs by the CPU.
These roles are described in detail in the text and will
be illustrated during the course of this lab, but here
for your reference is a brief summary:</p>

<UL>
<LI>
The X and Y registers hold two
sixteen-bit binary numbers that are used as input by the
ALU. For example, when the CPU needs to add two numbers, it
must put them into the X and Y registers so that the ALU can
be used to add them.
<LI>
The AC register is the
accumulator.  It is the CPU's &quot;working memory&quot; for its
calculations.  When the ALU is used to compute a result,
that result is stored in the AC.  For example, if the
numbers in the X and Y registers are added, then the
answer will appear in the AC. Also, data can be moved
from main memory into the AC and from the AC into main
memory.
<LI>
The FLAG register stores the
&quot;carry-out&quot; bit produced when the ALU adds two binary
numbers.  Also, when the ALU performs a shift-left or
shift-right operation, the extra bit that is shifted off
the end of the number is stored in the FLAG register.
<LI>
The ADDR register specifies a
location in main memory.  The CPU often needs to read values from
memory or write values to memory.  Only one location in
memory is accessible at any given time.  The ADDR
register specifies that location.  So, for example, if
the CPU needs to read the value in location 375, it must
first store 375 into the ADDR register.  (If you turn on
the &quot;Autoscroll&quot; checkbox beneath the memory
display, then the memory will automatically be scrolled to
the location indicated by the ADDR register every time the
value in that register changes.)
<LI>
The PC register is the program
counter.  The CPU executes a program by fetching
instructions one-by-one from memory and executing them.
(This is called the <font color="#E70000">fetch-and-execute cycle</font>.)
The PC specifies the location in memory that holds the
next instruction to be executed.
<LI>
The IR is the instruction
register.  When the CPU fetches a program instruction
from main memory, this is where it puts it. The IR holds
that instruction while it is being executed.
<LI>
The COUNT register counts off
the steps in a fetch-and-execute cycle.  It takes the CPU
several steps to fetch and execute an instruction. When
COUNT is 1, it does step 1; when COUNT is 2, it does
step 2; and so forth. The last step is always to reset
COUNT to 0, to get ready to start the next
fetch-and-execute cycle. This is easier to understand
after you see it in action.  Remember that as the
COUNT register counts 0, 1, 2,..., just <strong>one</strong>
machine language program is being executed.
</UL>

<p>You will learn how the xComputer works by giving it a
short program and watching it execute that program.  
A program is a sequence of assembly language instructions.
You have to enter the instructions into the xComputer's
memory.  But first, make sure that the &quot;addr&quot;
input box in the Control area of the applet contains
a zero.  The number in this box specifies the address in memory
where the instruction that you type will be stored.  Then,
type the following instructions into the &quot;data&quot;
input box.  Press return after each instruction
(or, equivalently, click the &quot;Data to Memory&quot;
button):</p>

<pre>              lod-c 17
              add-c 105
              sto 10
              hlt
</pre>

<p>When you press return, an instruction is translated
into a machine language instruction and is stored in
the xComputer's memory.  (You'll actually see a number in
the memory, rather than the assembly language instruction
that you typed.  For example, the instruction
&quot;<font color="#007000">lod-c 17</font>&quot; is represented by the number
25617.)  Note that when you press return, the number
in the &quot;addr&quot; input box is automatically
incremented by one, to get ready for storing the next
instruction that you type in the next memory location.
</p>

<p>The first instruction of this program, <font color="#007000">lod-c
17</font>, tells the xComputer to load the constant 17 into the accumulator.
The second instruction, <font color="#007000">add-c 105</font>
tells the computer to add the constant 105 to whatever number
is in the accumulator and to put the result back into the
accumulator.  The <font color="#007000">sto 10</font> makes
the computer copy the contents of the accumulator into
memory location 10.  And the final instruction, 
<font color="#007000">hlt</font>, tells the computer to halt.
The net effect is that the program adds 105 to 17 and
stores the answer in location 10.  After the program
halts, you can look in memory at location 10 to find the
answer.</p>


<p>Now, how do you make the computer <strong>run</strong>
the program?  All the computer ever does is fetch instructions
from memory and execute them.  The value stored in the PC
register tells the computer which memory location to
go to to get the next instruction.  Before running
the program, you have to make sure that it will begin
with the first instruction of the program, which is in
memory location zero.  This means that the PC register
should contain a zero.  If this is not the case, you
can put a zero into the PC by clicking the &quot;Set PC = 0&quot;
button in the Control section of the applet.  (Zero
is the most common starting value for the PC, but if
you want to start at a different location, you can type
the address of that location into the &quot;addr&quot;
input box and click the &quot;Addr to PC&quot; button.)</p>

<p>Once you have checked the value of the PC register,
you can just click on the &quot;Run&quot; button to run
the program.  You should think of this as turning on
the xComputer's clock.  As soon as you do this, the
clock stars ticking, the value in the COUNT register
starts changing, and the fetch-and-execute cycle proceeds.
This will continue until the computer executes a
<font color="#007000">HLT</font> instruction, or until
you stop it.</p>

<p>You should <strong>Try this now</strong>.  Make sure that
the PC contains a zero.  Then, click on the &quot;Run&quot;
button. If you have done everything correctly, the
program will run.  You will see things happening, although
you will probably not really understand them at this point. 
But you will notice that the instructions in the program
appear one by one in the IR register as they are
executed. Eventually, the <font color="#007000">HLT</font>
instruction will be
executed and the computer will stop running. The correct
answer to the computation, 122, will be in memory
location 10.  This gives you the general idea of how
programs are executed by xComputer.  Your goal in the
rest of the lab is to understand the details.</p>

<p>After running the program once, you should run it again.
First, <strong>reset the PC to zero</strong>.  This time,
instead of using the &quot;Run&quot; button, use the
&quot;Cycle&quot; button.  Clicking on &quot;Cycle&quot;
makes the computer run, but only until the value in 
the COUNT register is 2.  At that point, the computer
has just loaded a new instruction into the IR and is
about to execute that instruction.  When you click on
&quot;Cycle&quot; again, the computer will execute that
instruction and fetch the next instruction.  Thus, the
&quot;Cycle&quot; button lets you step through a program
one instruction at a time.  Try it!  Keep clicking on
&quot;Cycle&quot; until you get to the <font color="#007000">HLT</font>
instruction.</p>

<p>Finally, you can run the program one more time, this time
with the &quot;Step&quot; button.  Clicking on the &quot;Step&quot;
button makes the computer perform a single step in the fetch-and-execute
cycle.  You have to click on it several times just to execute
one instruction in the program.  Once again, you should
<strong>reset the PC to zero</strong>.  Then, click
through your program with the &quot;Step&quot; button
until the <font color="#007000">HLT</font> is executed.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="programs">Writing Programs for xComputer</A></font></H3>

<p>It should be clear that entering a long program into
xComputer by typing it into the &quot;data&quot; box would be
very tedious and error-prone. If you accidentally leave
out one instruction, for example, you might have to
retype most of the program!  Fortunately, the xComputer
applet lets you type a complete program in a
separate text-input area and then translate the whole
program at once and store it in xComputer's memory.
This has three advantages:  You can
edit the program in the window, for example by inserting
a new instruction.  You can (if the configuration of
your Web browser permits it) save the program
in a file, so that you'll never have to retype it again. 
And you can use <font color="#E70000">labels</font>
in your program.  Labels
are a powerful programming technique; they are described
in the Postscript to Chapter 3 in the text.  They are not
covered in this lab, but they will be an important part
of the <A HREF="xComputerLab2.html">next lab</A>.</p>

<p>If you want to type a new program, just click on
the &quot;New Program&quot; button in the Control area
of the applet.  Alternatively, you can select &quot;[New]&quot;
from the pop-up menu at the very top of the applet.  
The computer display will disappear and will be replaced
by a text-input area when you can type your program.
Enter the following program into that text area:

<pre>          lod-c 1
          sto 12
          lod 12
          inc
          sto 12
          jmp 2
</pre>

<p>This program <strong>counts</strong>.
It starts by putting the number 1 into memory
location 12, and then it adds one
to the number in that location over and over, forever. 
(You'll see this in action in a moment.) There are
several new instructions here.  
<font color="#007000">Lod 12</font> tells xComputer to
copy the number from memory location 12 into the
accumulator.  (Note how this differs from
<font color="#007000">lod-c 12</font>,
which puts the number 12 itself into the AC, rather
than the number stored in memory location 12.)  The
<font color="#007000">inc</font>
instruction adds one to the value in the accumulator. 
And <font color="#007000">jmp 2</font>
is a jump instruction that sends the computer
back to location 2.</p>

<p>After typing this program, click on the
&quot;Translate&quot; button that is located below
the text area, on the left end of a row of buttons.
If the program contains some error, an error message
will be displayed.  If you've typed the program correctly,
it will be translated into machine language and stored
in the xComputer's memory.  The text area will be
replaced by the computer display, and the computer will
be ready to run the program.  Click on the &quot;Run&quot;
button to run the program and see how it operates.
You can watch as the PC counts off the instructions in
the program.  You will see the assembly language
instructions themselves as they are loaded into the IR.
And you can observe that the value in memory location 12
changes from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 and so on.  This
program will run forever, if you let it.</p>

<p>You will be working with this little program throughout
most of the remainder of the lab. Your objective is to understand
how xComputer operates and to appreciate the
fetch-and-execute cycle.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="options">Controlling Speed and Memory Display Style</A></font></H3>

<p>As you let the counting program run, you can try varying the
speed at which the computer executes instructions by
changing the setting on the speed pop-up menu
(located just below the &quot;Run&quot; button.
The lower speeds allow you to watch what is happening
in more detail.  The higher speeds allow the computer
to get more done.  At the very highest speed, the
registers are not displayed, so that the computer can run
as quickly as possible, without updating the register
display all the time.</p>

<p>When you have had enough of this, <strong>stop the program</strong>
and experiment with the memory display style pop-up menu,
which is located just above the scrolling memory display.
This menu allows you to select how you would like to view
the contents of main memory.  (There is also a similar
pop-up menu for setting the register display style.)
Of course, the actual contents of memory are binary numbers,
but a binary number can mean many things, depending on 
how it is interpreted. 
When the applet first starts up, it is set to display
the contents of memory as ordinary decimal integers in the
range -32768 to 32767.  This is only one
possible interpretation of the binary numbers that
are stored in memory.  Using the display style pop-up menu,
you can select from six different interpretations:</p>

<UL>
<LI>
The <font color="#E70000">Instructions</font>
display shows the contents of each
memory location as an assembly language instruction.  In
this display style, you should see the original counting
program in memory locations 0 through 5.  Most of the
other locations contain <font color="#007000">Add 0</font>,
which just happens to
be the assembly language instruction encoded by the
16-bit binary number 0000000000000000.  (Since not every
16-bit binary number corresponds to a legitimate
assembly-language instruction, you might see some funny
things in this display style.)
<LI>
The <font color="#E70000">Integers</font> and
<font color="#E70000">Unsigned Ints</font> displays show
ordinary decimal integers. The difference is that signed
16-bit integers are in the range -32768 to 32767, while
unsigned 16-bit integers are in the range 0 to 65535. 
(In either case, there are 2<sup>16</sup> different possible
values -- it's just a question of how they are
interpreted.  See Subsection 2.2.3 in the text.)
<LI>
The <font color="#E70000">Binary</font>
display shows a 16-bit binary number in each
memory location; this display style is closest to the
actual physical contents of the memory.
<LI>
The <font color="#E70000">ASCII</font>
display interprets each sixteen-bit number in
memory as made up of two eight-bit ASCII  character
codes, and shows the two characters.  Some eight-bit
binary numbers do not represent visible ASCII characters.
These numbers are shown in the form &lt;#N&gt;, where
N is the number, in decimal form.  Thus, for
example, the 16-bit binary number 0000000000000000
is shown in ASCII display style as &lt;#0&gt;&lt;#0&gt;.
<LI>
The <font color="#E70000">Graphics</font>
display is very different from the others. 
It shows the <strong>entire</strong> memory at once.
Each bit in memory -- all 16 times 1024 of them -- is
represented by
one pixel on the screen.  That pixel is white if the bit
is zero and is black if the bit is one.  If you choose
the Graphics display now, the memory will be almost
entirely white, except for a few black dots at the top
that represent the program you entered into memory.
</UL>

<p>You can try out the various memory display styles.
You'll be using them in Exercise 1 at the end of the lab.
I should note that when you enter information into Memory
using the &quot;data&quot; input box in the Control area
of the applet, you can type
the information in several of the above display styles,
as well as in assembly language.  You can, for example,
enter ordinary numbers in the range -32768 to 65535. 
You can enter a binary number, but you must precede it by
the letter B. For example: B1011010111.  Finally, you can
enter one or two ASCII characters, but you must precede
them by a quote mark.  For example: '#1 or 'A.  You will
need to do this for Exercise 1.</p>

<p>There is another option in the pop-up menu:
&quot;Control Wires&quot;.  This display
style doesn't show memory at all.  If you select it,
the computer's memory display will be replaced by a list of 
<font color="#E70000">control wires</font>.
These control wires are the key to understanding how the
xComputer works.  The basic idea is that turning control
wires on and off makes things happen in the computer.
They are turned on and off by a
<font color="#E70000">Control Circuit</font>, and
they control the operation of other
components of the CPU.  Each control wire has a function.
Turning that wire on causes something to happen, such as
moving a number from main memory into the AC register or
adding the numbers in the X and Y registers and putting
the answer into the AC.  Executing a program is just a
matter of turning the right wires on and off in the right
sequence.</p>

<p>The &quot;Control Wires&quot; display lets you see what
wires are turned on during each step in the execution
of an instruction.  Try it with the instruction
<font color="#007000">lod-c 17</font>,
by doing the following:  <strong>First</strong>,
enter the instruction &quot;lod-c 17&quot; into
some memory location, and set the PC to the address of
that location.  <strong>Next</strong>, set the
display style to &quot;Control Wires&quot;.
<strong>Then</strong>, use the &quot;Step&quot;
button to go through the fetch-and-execute cycle
one step at a time.  Here's what you will see:</p>

<UL>
<LI>
First click on the &quot;Step&quot; button: COUNT
becomes 1, indicating that the first step in the fetch
and execute cycle is being performed. The
Load-addr-from-PC control wire is turned on, and the
value in the PC register is copied into the ADDR
register.  (The PC register tells which memory location
holds the next instruction; that location number must be
copied into the ADDR register so that the computer can
read that instruction from memory.)
<LI>
Second click: COUNT becomes
2. The Load-IR-from-Memory control wire is turned on, and
an instruction is copied from memory into
the IR.  (The ADDR register determines which instruction
is read.)  In this case, the instruction is Lod-c 17.
<LI>
Third click: COUNT becomes 3. The
Increment-PC control wire is turned on, and the value
in the PC register is incremented by 1.  Ordinarily,
this prepares the PC for the
<strong>next</strong> fetch-and-execute cycle.  This completes
the &quot;fetch&quot; portion of the fetch-and-execute cycle. 
The remaining steps in the cycle depend on the particular instruction
that is begin executed (in this case, lod-c 17).
<LI>
Fourth click: COUNT becomes 4. The
Load-AC-from-IR control wire is turned on.
The data part of the instruction in the IR register,
is copied into the accumulator.  In this case,
the value is 17.  This is the only step
necessary to execute the lod-c 17 instruction.
<LI>
Fifth click: COUNT becomes 5,
but only briefly.  The Set-COUNT-to-Zero control wire
is turned on and immediately the value of COUNT is reset
to 0. One fetch-and-execute cycle is over.  (On the next
click, COUNT would become 1 again, and the next cycle
would begin.
</UL>

<p>As you click on the &quot;Step&quot; button in this exercise,
you are actually simulating the role of the xComputer's clock. 
Each click has the same effect as one tick of the clock,
and you are driving the computation at your leisure in
the same way as the ticking of the clock usually drives
the computer with its regular ticking.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="count">Count and Store</A></font></H3>

<p>For the last part of the lab, consider the following
program, &quot;CountAndStore&quot;.  This program should
have been automatically loaded by the xComputer applet,
so you won't have to type it in.  Just select it from
the pop-up menu at the top of the applet, and click
on the &quot;Translate&quot; button to store it in
the xComputer's memory.  Note that in an xComputer
program, anything that comes after a semicolon on
a line is a comment, which is meant for human readers.
Comments are ignored by the computer.</p>

<pre>
     lod-c 1     ; Start with a 1 in location 12
     sto 12

     lod 12      ; This instruction is stored in location 2
     inc
     sto 13      ; This instruction is stored in location 4

     lod 2       ; Add 1 to the number in location 2
     inc
     sto 2

     lod 4       ; Add 1 to the number in location 4
     inc
     sto 4

     jmp 2       ; Go back to the instruction in location 2

</pre>

<p>This program is similar to the simple
counting program that you looked at earlier in the
lab, except that the number for the
second <font color="#007000">sto</font>
command has been changed, and six new instructions
have been inserted before the 
<font color="#007000">jmp</font> command.
The instructions &quot;<font color="#007000">lod 2,
inc, sto 2</font>&quot; add 1 to the number stored
in memory location 2.  But if you look at what's stored 
in that location, you'll find the instruction
<font color="#007000">lod 12</font>, which is part
of the program.  This seems odd.  What happens when you &quot;add
1&quot; to an <strong>instruction</strong>?</p>

<p>Remember that machine language instructions are really just
numbers.  There is no problem with adding 1 to a number. 
However, the meaning of the instruction represented by the
number is changed.  If you add 1 to the number that
encodes &quot;<font color="#007000">lod 12</font>,&quot;
the meaning of the answer is &quot;<font color="#007000">lod13</font>.&quot;
If you want to understand exactly why this is true, look at
the binary representations of the machine language instructions.
(The details are given in Section 3.2 of the text, if you want
to check there.)</p>

<p>Run this program and see what it does.
To fully appreciate this program, you should run it
at &quot;Fastest Speed&quot; with the memory display set
to &quot;Graphics&quot;.  You can watch as the memory
is gradually filled with numbers.</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>
You can use the xComputer to translate from one type of
data to another by entering it in one form in the

form.  Use this method to do the following conversions,
and explain briefly how you do each part:</p>

    1023</font>.
<LI>Now, Add 1 to the number that represents
    <font color="#007000">sto 1023</font>
    and find the assembly language instruction
    represented by the resulting number.
    Why do you get a completely different instruction?
   (Note: Do the addition yourself; you don't have to
   program the computer to do it!)
</OL>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>
In reality, the memory of a computer contains only binary numbers.
Machine language, in particular, consists of binary numbers.
Translate the counting program, which is repeated below, into the
binary numbers of machine language, and write a paragraph or
two explaining <strong>why</strong> computers use binary
numbers instead of something more readable.</p>

<pre>             lod-c 17
             sto 12
             lod 12
             inc
             sto 12
             jmp 2
</pre>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>
Write an assembly language program that computes
34 - 17 + 103 - 12.  The instruction for
subtracting a constant from the accumulator is
<font color="#007000">sub-c</font>.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
Earlier in the lab, you were asked to step through
the execution of the instruction
<font color="#007000">lod-c 17</font>,
which tells the computer to load the number 17 into
the accumulator.
The instruction <font color="#007000">lod 17</font>
tells the computer to copy the contents of memory location
17 into the accumulator.  Use xComputer to watch as
this instruction is executed step-by-step, just as you did above for
the <font color="#007000">lod-c 17</font>. 
Enter a <font color="#007000">lod 17</font> instruction into
memory location zero, and <strong>reset the PC to zero</strong>.
Set the display style to &quot;Control
Wires&quot;. Then use the &quot;Step&quot; button to
step through the fetch-and-execute cycle as
the <font color="#007000">lod</font> instruction is executed.
Write down what happens during each step. Carefully
explain the purpose of each step in the execute
phase of the cycle (steps 4 and later).  What differences
do you find between the execution of a 
<font color="#007000">lod-c</font> instruction
and the execution of a <font color="#007000">lod</font> instruction?
How can the differences be explained in terms of what the
instructions do?
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>
Use the &quot;Step&quot; button to trace the execution
of an <font color="#007000">add-c</font> instruction
and of an <font color="#007000">add</font> instruction.
(See Exercise 4 for detailed instructions about how to
do this.)  Record the control wires that are on during
each step in the execute part of the fetch and execute
cycle, that is for steps number 4 and later, and carefully
explain the purpose of each of those steps.  What differences
do you observe between these two instructions?
How can the differences be explained in terms of what the
instructions do?</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
Carefully explain why the first three steps of the
fetch-and-execute cycle are always the same, and why 
they have nothing to do with the contents of the 
instruction register.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>
Modify the first counting
program used in this lab so that it will count just from
one to sixteen, stopping when it reaches sixteen. 
(The program is repeated below.)  To do
this, each time through the loop,
you need to test whether the number is sixteen.
If it is, jump to a <font color="#007000">HLT</font>
instruction at the end of the program.  Testing whether
a number is sixteen requires two steps:
First, subtract 16 from the number, and 
then test whether the answer is zero.  Use a
<font color="#007000">JMZ</font> instruction to
test whether the answer is zero.
(This is like a <font color="#007000">JMP</font>
instruction, except that the jump only occurs if the
number in the AC is zero.)  Write a paragraph
explaining how your program works.</p>

<pre>          lod-c 1    ; This is the original counting program.
          sto 12
          lod 12
          inc
          sto 12
          jmp 2
          hlt        ; Add a halt instruction at the end.
</pre>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font>
Describe what is done by
the &quot;CountAndStore&quot; program, which you
encountered earlier in the
lab.  Discuss <strong>how</strong> it works in some detail.
To do a good job on this exercise, you will have to
step through several executions of the loop in the program
and study how it works.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font>
Discuss what you learn from the &quot;CountAndStore&quot;
program about &quot;data&quot; and &quot;instructions&quot;
and the relationship between them.  (The memory of a
computer can hold both data and instructions.  How does
the computer distinguish between them?  Does it?)</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 10:</b></font>
Run the &quot;CountAndStore&quot; program at &quot;Fastest
Speed&quot; with the display set to &quot;Graphics.&quot;
If you let the program run long enough, it will halt.
How is this possible, since the program contains no
<font color="#007000">HLT</font> instruction?  To figure
this out, you'll need to do some detective work after the
program ends.  Look at what has happened to the program
in the computer's memory.  Try to be as explicit and
complete with your explanation as possible.  This is
not an easy question.
(Hint: something you did in Exercise 1 turns out to
be relevant here.)</p>
