<p><font size="+2">T</font>HIS LAB CONTINUES THE STUDY OF CIRCUITS built from
logic gates, which was begun in the <A HREF="xLogicCircuitsLab1.html">previous lab</A>.
That lab showed how circuits can be built to perform arithmetic and logical
computations with binary numbers.  Such computations are one of the major functions of
computers.  But computers also need at least two other abilities.  They
need <font color="#E70000">memory</font> --  the ability to store and
retrieve data.  And they need <font color="#E70000">control</font> -- the
ability to control what data is stored where, which computations are 
performed, and in what order.  A program specifies a series of computations
to be performed by a computer; the computer stores program and data in its
memory, and the computer executes the program under its own control, without any 
further direction from its user or programmer.  You already have some
idea how circuits can perform computations.  In this lab, you'll
see how logic gates can be used to build <font color="#E70000">memory circuits</font>
that can store binary numbers (which are used to represent both programs and data).
As for control functions, they can also be implemented with gates and wires.
There were some hints of this in the previous lab, and you'll see more in
this lab.  However, the full mystery of how a computer can execute a program
all on its own will not be solved until future labs.

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="memory">Circuits that Remember</A></font></H3>

<p>You've seen that a circuit that does not have any feedback loops
simply takes the values from its inputs and computes an output value
based on those inputs.  Changing the values on the input wires will
change the output values -- after just a very short delay for the signal
to pass through the circuit.  Such circuits have no &quot;memory.&quot;
The output is computed based on the current inputs, and anything that
happened to the circuit in the <b>past</b> has no effect.</p>

<p>In this lab, we are interested in circuits that have some memory of
what happened to them in the past.  That is, the output of the circuit
is not based solely on the current inputs.  It can also depend on inputs
that were given to the circuit in the past.  Memory circuits include
feedback loops.  A feedback loop occurs when the output from a gate
is connected back to an input of the same gate -- possibly through one
or more other gates.  Such a loop allows <b>previous</b> inputs to
affect <b>current</b> outputs.  This is exactly what we need for
memory circuits.</p>

<p>The xLogicCircuits applet is set up to load several examples.  You 
should see three sample circuits on the circuit board.  Each of these
is a simple circuit containing a feedback loop.  You should
<b>turn on the power</b> and experiment with these circuits.</p>

<p>The first circuit consists of a NOT gate, with its output connected
back to its input.  What happens to this circuit when you turn on the
power?  This is not what I would call a memory circuit!  It shows that
not every circuit that contains a feedback loop can properly be called
a memory circuit.  (In fact, building memory circuits is a pretty touchy
affair.)  However, even this simple example of a feedback loop turns 
out to be useful and interesting, as you'll see in some of the exercises at
the end of the lab.</p>

<p>The second example on the circuit board is an OR gate whose output
is fed back to one of its inputs:

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic6.gif" 
                          ALT="OR gate with feedback loop" WIDTH="355" HEIGHT="93"></p>

<p>The other input to the OR gate is under your control.
As soon as you turn this input on, the feedback loop turns on and the
output of the circuit comes on.  After that, you can turn the input off
and on as much as you want.  The output stays on (until you turn off the
power to the circuit).  The circuit &quot;remembers&quot; that its input
has been turned on sometime in the past.  This is interesting, but it
would be nice to have a way of turning the circuit off.  The third
example on the circuit board shows how this can be done:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic7.gif" 
                       ALT="Simple store-one/store-zero circuit" WIDTH="423" HEIGHT="87"></p>

<p>This circuit also contains an OR gate in a feedback loop, but now an
AND gate has been inserted into the loop.  If you turn the input labeled
&quot;Turn-it-ON&quot; on and then off, the feedback loop and the output of
the circuit will come ON.  If you turn the other input, labeled &quot;Turn-it-OFF,&quot;
on and then off, the loop and output will go OFF.  This circuit remembers 
which of its inputs was most recently turned on and off.  Since we want to work with
binary numbers, we think of ON as representing one and OFF as representing
zero.  We say that we <font color="#E70000">store one</font> in the
circuit by turning the top input on and off, and that we <font color="#E70000">store
zero</font> in the circuit by turning the lower input on and off.  The circuit
stores the value zero or one.  You can check which value it is storing just by
looking at its output.  You can set the value that it is storing by 
manipulating its inputs.  This simple memory circuit is the basic building
block for most of what you will see in this lab.</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>In the previous lab, you saw that it is often convenient to think of
some inputs to a circuit of as carrying <font color="#E70000">data</font>
into the circuit, while other inputs are used to <font color="#E70000">control</font>
the circuit.  The circuit itself doesn't really make any distinction between
two different types of inputs, but it useful for designers of circuits
to distinguish between <font color="#E70000">data inputs</font> and
<font color="#E70000">control inputs</font> depending on what
functions the inputs serve in their circuit design.  All the circuits
that you see in the rest of this lab follow the following convention:</p>

<UL>
<LI><b>Circuit outputs are on the right edge of the circuit.</b>
<LI><b>Data inputs are on the left edge of the circuit.</b>
<LI><b>Control inputs are on the top and bottom edges of the circuit.</b>
</UL>

<p>In the simple memory circuit discussed above, it is not really clear to
me whether the two input wires are data inputs or control inputs.  For this
reason -- and also because it will fit better into the design of other
circuits -- we will use a modified version of this memory circuit for
the rest of the lab.  The basic memory circuit that we will use is
in the example called &quot;1-Bit Mem&quot;.  You'll find this circuit
in the scrolling pallette in the xLogicCircuits applet.  (Remember that
you can use the circuits in the pallette as building blocks in other 
circuits simply by dragging them onto the circuit board.  You can also
see inside any iconified circuit; just click on the circuit to hilite
it and then click the &quot;Enlarge&quot; button.)</p>

<p>The one-bit memory circuit can store one bit, either zero or one.  
You won't need to understand the inside of this circuit, but it
important that you understand how it is used.  The circuit has one
data input, one control input, and one output.   I refer to these
as DATA-IN, LOAD-DATA, and DATA-OUT:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic8.gif" ALT="1-Bit Mem" WIDTH="481" HEIGHT="139"></p>

<p>To store a value in the circuit, turn the DATA-IN wire ON or OFF to
represent the value (ON for one or OFF for zero).  Turn LOAD-DATA on and
off.  (You have to do this slowly enough to allow the circuit time to
react.)  When you turn LOAD-DATA on, the value from DATA-IN will flow into
the circuit.  When you turn LOAD-DATA off, the value in the circuit will
be &quot;locked&quot; and cannot change until the next time LOAD-DATA is
turned on.  You can always check what value is stored in the circuit
by looking at its output wire, DATA-OUT.</p>

<p>Open the &quot;1-Bit Mem&quot; circuit, turn on the power, and work with it 
to make sure that you know how to use it.</p>

<p>With the basic one-bit memory as a starting
point, you can build more complex memory circuits.  Just as you can line
up several &quot;Adder&quot; circuits to get a multibit addition circuit,
you can combine several one-bit memory circuits to get a multibit memory circuit.
As one of the exercises at the end of the lab, you will construct a 
4-bit memory circuit.  A 4-bit memory circuit can store a 4-bit binary
number.  Similarly, you can build memory circuits to store 8-bit binary
numbers, 16-bit numbers, or any number of bits.  Memory circuits of
this type are important components in the central processing unit
of a computer.  A memory circuit that is used in the central
processing unit to store a binary number is called a
<font color="#E70000">register</font>.  Multibit memory circuits can also
be used in the main memory of a computer.  Recall that main memory
contains a sequence of numbered locations.  Each location stores a binary
number, so each location can be a simple multibit memory circuit.</p>

<p>For some purposes, a more sophisticated type of multibit memory is
needed.  As an example, look at the &quot;Count Reg&quot; circuit,
which you will find in the pallette of the xLogicCircuits applet.
This circuit is a register that <b>counts</b> in binary.  Turn its
control wire on and off several times (allowing, as always, enough
time for the circuit to respond).  As you keep turning the control wire
ON and OFF, the three outputs of the circuit will cycle 
through the values 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, and back to 
000.  (Read the outputs from bottom to top.)
If you convert these binary numbers to decimal numbers, the
circuit is counting from zero to seven.  A count register of this sort could
be used in a CPU to count off the steps in a computation, for example.</p>

<p>The count register is made from three &quot;Flip Flop&quot; circuits.
It is not important for you to understand how a flip-flop works,
but if you look inside, you'll see that it is made from two interconnected
one-bit memories of the type you have seen above.  In fact, a flip-flop
is itself a kind one-bit memory, but it can do things that the simpler
one-bit memory cannot -- such as count.  The count register is used in
one of the exercises at the end of the lab, but mainly it is here to
show you that registers can be made to do more than just store numbers.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="ram">Random Access Memory</A></font></H3>

<p>A <font color="#E70000">random access memory</font>, or RAM, is a memory
circuit that can hold several different binary numbers.  Each binary number is
stored in a separate <font color="#E70000">location</font>.  The locations
are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.  The number of a location is called
its <font color="#E70000">address</font>.  Every computer has a RAM,
which it uses as a <font color="E70000">main memory</font> where it stores
the data and programs that it is working with.  A RAM can have any given
number of locations.  (In a typical computer, the RAM has several million
locations.)  The binary numbers that are stored in a RAM can have any
given number of bits.  (In a typical modern computer, each location holds
an eight-bit binary number.)</p>

<p>In this section, you'll see how a very simple RAM can be constructed.  The RAM
you will look at has only two locations, and each location holds just a 
single bit.  The exercises at the end of the lab will investigate how larger and
more useful RAM's can be built.</p>

<p>The sample RAM is named &quot;2-Bit RAM&quot;.  It is one of the
sample circuits loaded by the xLogicCircuits applet.  Find it in the
applet's pallette and open it.  You'll see a circuit with one
data input, two control inputs, and one output:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic10.gif" ALT="2-Bit RAM circuit" 
                                WIDTH="530" HEIGHT="326"></p>
                                
<p>The ADDRESS wire picks out one of the two locations in the RAM.
When the ADDRESS wire is OFF, one location is used (the location &quot;with
address zero&quot;).  When the ADDRESS wire is ON, the other location is
used (the location &quot;with address one&quot;).  The DATA-OUT wire
shows the contents of the selected location.  Turning the LOAD-DATA
wire on and off stores a value in the selected location.  The DATA-IN
wire specifies the value that is to be stored.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to store a 1 in location 0.  Then you should:</p>

<UL>
<LI>Turn the DATA-IN wire ON, representing the value 1.
<LI>Turn the ADDRESS wire OFF, representing the address of location 0.
<LI>Turn the LOAD-DATA wire ON.
<LI>Wait long enough for the signals to propagate through the circuit.
<LI>Turn the LOAD-DATA wire OFF.
</UL>

<p>To read the value stored in location 0, all you have to do is turn
the ADDRESS wire OFF to represent the address of the location you
want to read.  The value stored in location 0 will appear on the DATA-OUT
wire.</p>

<p>If you want to work with location 1 instead of with location 0, all you have
to do is turn the ADDRESS wire ON.</p>

<p>A real RAM should have more than one ADDRESS wire.  Every combination
of values that can be put on the ADDRESS wires specifies a different address.
For example, if there are three address wires, they can be set to any
of the eight combinations OFF-OFF-OFF, OFF-OFF-ON, OFF-ON-OFF, OFF-ON-ON,
ON-OFF-OFF, ON-OFF-ON, ON-ON-OFF, and ON-ON-ON.  These combinations represent
the binary numbers 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111.  In ordinary
decimal notation, they represent 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  So, a RAM
with three ADDRESS wires can have eight locations, numbered 0 through 7.
Twenty ADDRESS wires are enough to specify over a million locations, 
and thirty ADDRESS wires can specify over a billion.</p>

<HR width="50%">

<p>You should spend some time understanding how to use the &quot;2-Bit RAM&quot;
and how it works.  Each of the two locations in the RAM is a
&quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot; circuit.  This circuit is similar to the
basic &quot;1-Bit Mem&quot; circuit that you looked at above, but it has
an addition control input, called the GUARD:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xLogic9.gif" ALT="Guarded 1-Bit Mem" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="162"></p>

<p>When the GUARD of a location is ON, that location is selected.  When it is 
selected, it outputs its stored value on its DATA-OUT wire, and its
LOAD-DATA wire can be used to store a new value in it.  When the GUARD is OFF,
the &quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot; is inert.  It ignores its LOAD-DATA wire and
leaves its DATA-OUT wire turned OFF.</p>

<p>The &quot;1-Bit Decode&quot; is used to make sure that exactly one
of the two locations is selected at any given time.  The ADDRESS wire is
used as input to the Decode circuit.  The Decode circuit has two outputs.
When the ADDRESS wire is OFF, the Decode circuit turns its lower output ON,
and this in turn selects one of the &quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot; circuits.
When the ADDRESS wire is ON, the Decode circuit turns its upper output ON,
and this in turn selects the other &quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot; circuit.
Thus, the Decode circuit decodes the ADDRESS to decide which location to select.</p>

<p>Finally, the OR gate is necessary so that both locations will be able to
send their output to the DATA-OUT wire of the RAM.  You can't connect
two wires to one output.  Using the OR gate allows either of the
&quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot; circuits to turn on the output.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="exercises">Exercises</A></font></H3>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>
A <font color="#E70000">clock</font> in a computer is a component that
&quot;ticks&quot; by turning its output wire on and off.  This regular ticking
can be used as a signal by other components in the computer.  Open the
sample circuit &quot;Clock&quot; in the applet that you
launched <A HREF="#launch">above</A>.
This example is a clock that will start ticking (by turning its output
on and off) as soon as you turn the power off.  However, you can stop the
ticking by turning on the clock's control wire at the top of the circuit.
Turning this control wire off will restart the clock.  Write a few paragraphs
explaining exactly how this circuit works.  Why does the clock tick?
What process does the clock go through as it turns its output on, then off,
then back on?  What is the role of the OR gate?  (<b>Note</b>: The &quot;Tacks&quot;
in the feedback loop serve to slow the ticking down, because in this simulated
circuit, it takes a bit of time for a signal to propagate from one Tack, along
a wire, to the next Tack.  In a real circuit, the length of the feedback loop
could be used to control how long a signal takes to circle the loop.)
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>  This is a continuation
of Exercise 1.  As an example of using the signal from a clock to 
drive another component, build a circuit in which the output from a
&quot;Clock&quot; circuit is connected to the control wire of a
&quot;Count Reg&quot; circuit.  The circuit you build should have
three outputs, which are connected to the outputs from the Count Register.
It should also have one control input, which is connected to the Clock's
control wire.  When you turn the power on, the ticking of the Clock will make
the Count Register count, and it will do so as long as the control wire is
turned off.  This circuit just counts up to 7 before it goes back to 
zero.  How would you make a circuit that counts up to 15 before it goes
back to zero?  
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>  One of the sample circuits,
&quot;1-Bit Mem&quot;, is capable of storing a one-bit binary number.
Construct a four-bit memory that can store a four-bit binary number.
It can be built using four copies of &quot;1-Bit Mem&quot;.  Your circuit
should have four DATA-IN wires and four DATA-OUT wires.  However, it 
should have only one LOAD-DATA control wire.  You want to load data
from the DATA-IN wires into all the &quot;1-Bit Mem&quot; circuits
at the same time.  This will be done by turning the single LOAD-DATA
wire on and off.
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font> This continues Exercise 3.
Explain in detail how you would store the binary number 1011 in the
four-bit memory that you constructed for Exercise 3.  Also, explain
carefully what it <b>means</b> to say that this value is &quot;stored&quot; in
the memory.
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font> This exercise uses the
four-bit memory that you built for Exercise 3.  One of the examples
in this lab was a &quot;2-Bit RAM&quot; circuit that can store
two one-bit numbers.  It stores one number in each of two locations,
and an ADDRESS wire is used to determine which of the two locations is
in use.  Suppose that you want to store a <b>four-bit</b> number in each of
two locations.  The circuit would be very similar to the &quot;2-Bit RAM&quot;
but it would have four Inputs and four Outputs.  It would still have
just one LOAD-DATA control wire and one ADDRESS wire to select between
the two locations.  For this exercise, you should build such a 
circuit.  You can start with your four-bit memory.  Use it to build
a &quot;Guarded 4-Bit Mem&quot; modeled on the &quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot;
from the &quot;2-Bit RAM&quot; circuit.  Then use two
copies of the &quot;Guarded 4-Bit Mem&quot; to construct a RAM with
two locations.  Test
your circuit by storing a different four-bit number in each location.
Explain how you can check that your circuit has stored the numbers correctly.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>  The &quot;2-Bit RAM&quot;
sample circuit uses a &quot;1-Bit Decode&quot; circuit.  This circuit
has one input and two outputs.  It &quot;decodes&quot; its input by turning
one of its outputs on when its input is ON and by turning the other output
on if the input is OFF.  Similar decoder circuits with more inputs are
also useful.  For this exercise, build a two-bit decoder circuit.
Your circuit should have two Inputs and four Outputs.  The two inputs can
have any of the following pairs of values: 00, 01, 10, or 11.  Each of
these pairs corresponds to one of the Outputs.  The decoder circuit should
turn on a different output for each pair of inputs.  That is, if the inputs
have the value 00 (both OFF), then the circuit should turn on its first
Output; if the Inputs have the value 01, it should turn on its second
Output; and so on.  So at any given time, exactly one of the outputs will be
ON. (This is a fairly simple circuit. Begin by finding a Boolean algebra
expression for each of the outputs.)
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font> This is a continuation of
Exercise 6.  The two-bit decoder circuit that you built for Exercise 6
can be used as a component in a four-location RAM.  The four locations
in the RAM will be &quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot; circuits.  The RAM
will have two ADDRESS wires, which connect to the two
inputs of the decoder.  The four outputs from the decoder should
connect to the GUARD wires of the four &quot;Guarded 1-Bit Mem&quot;
circuits.  This allows the values on the ADDRESS wires to be used
to select one of the four locations.  For this exercise, build
such a four-location RAM.  (As in the original &quot;2-Bit RAM&quot;
example, each location should hold just one bit.)
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font> Based on your work in
Exercises 5 and 7, explain how it would, in principle, be possible
to build a RAM containing any given of locations, with any given
number of bits in each location.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font> Write a short essay explaining
what you learned in this lab about constructing complex circuits from
subcircuits.
