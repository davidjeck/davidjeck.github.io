       Introduction to Programming</font></H2>

<hr alignt=center width="50%">

<p><font size="+1">T</font>HIS LAB is an introduction to a high-level programming language
called <font color="#E70000">xTurtle</font>. This language was
created to be used with
<cite><A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The Most Complex
Machine</A></cite>, but it is in the mainstream of high-level
languages, along with Pascal, Ada and&nbsp;C.  It incorporates some
ideas common to all these languages, such as variables, assignment
statements, loops, if statements and subroutines.  (You should find
that you are already familiar with the basic ideas because of your
work in previous labs.) The xTurtle language also contains
special-purpose commands for doing <font color="#E70000">turtle
graphics</font>. These commands can be used to draw pictures on the
computer screen.  In this lab, you will learn about the basic
xTurtle commands, about loops and if statements, and
about variables.  Future labs will cover programming in more
detail, including the use of subroutines.</p>

<p>This lab covers some of the same material as Chapter 6 of
<cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>. The lab is meant as a
self-contained introduction to this material, but it would still be
useful to read Chapter 6 before doing the lab.</p>

<p>This lab includes the following sections:</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="basic">Basic xTurtle Commands</A></font></H3>

<p>When the xTurtle applet first starts up, it displays a 
white drawing area on the left, with a strip of controls
on the right.  There is a &quot;turtle&quot; in
the center of the drawing area, represented as a small
black triangle.  The turtle has a <font color="#E70000">position</font>
and a <font color="#E70000">heading</font>.
Its heading is the direction it is facing, given
as a number of degrees between -180 and 180.  The turtle has a
heading of zero when it is facing to the right, a heading of 90 when it
is facing upwards towards the top of the screen, and a heading of
-90 when it is facing downwards.  Its position is given
by two numbers: an <font color="#E70000">xcoord</font>,
or horizontal coordinate, and a <font color="#E70000">ycoord</font>, or
vertical coordinate.</p>

<p>The drawing area of the applet includes
a twenty-by-twenty square in which the turtle can move and draw.
This square has horizontal coordinates from -10 on the left to 10 on
the right, and it has vertical coordinates from -10 at the bottom
to 10 at the top.  Because the drawing area is unlikely to be
exactly square, the coordinates for the entire drawing area
probably extend beyond the range -10 to 10 in either the
horizontal or vertical direction.</p>

<p>The turtle starts out in the center
of the screen -- at the point (0,0) -- facing to the right.
It can obey commands such as &quot;<font color="#007000">forward(5)</font>,&quot;
which tells it to move forward five units, and &quot;<font color="#007000">turn(120)</font>,&quot;
which tells it to rotate in place through an angle of 120 degrees.
(It turns counterclockwise if the number of degrees in positive and
clockwise if the number of degrees is negative.)  The number in
parentheses is called a <font color="#E70000">parameter</font>
for the command; you can substitute any number you want.
The parameter in a &quot;forward&quot; command tells the turtle
<strong>how far</strong> to move forward, while the parameter
in the &quot;turn&quot; command tells it <strong>how many
degrees</strong> to turn.</p>

<p>The turtle can draw a line as it moves.  You can think of it as
dragging a pen that draws as the turtle moves.  The command
&quot;<font color="#007000">PenUp</font>&quot; tells the turtle to &quot;raise the pen.&quot;
While the pen is raised, the turtle will move without drawing
anything. The command &quot;<font color="#007000">PenDown</font>&quot; tells the turtle to
lower the pen again.</p>

<p>Just below the drawing area of the applet are a text-input
box and a button labeled &quot;Do It&quot;.  You can type
commands for the turtle in the text-input box.  When you
press return or click on the &quot;Do It&quot; button,
the turtle will carry out the command or commands that you
typed.   You can type in several commands at once, or
you can type in one command at a time, pressing return after each 
command.  Note also that after a command is executed, the contents 
of the text-input box are hilited, so that as soon as you start 
typing, the previous command will be erased and replaced with what
you type.  And finally, note that you can change the speed at which
the turtle follows a sequence of commands by changing the
setting of the Speed pop-up menu, which is one of the controls
located to the right of the drawing area.  (The speed is initially
set to &quot;Fast&quot;.)</p>

<p>As an exercise, you should try to make the turtle draw two separate,
parallel lines, like this:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xTurtle0.gif" WIDTH="270" HEIGHT="61"></p>

<p>If you make a mistake, you can use the command
&quot;<font color="#007000">clear</font>&quot; to clear
the screen and the command &quot;<font color="#007000">home</font>&quot;
to return the turtle to its original position and orientation
(at the center of the screen, facing right).</p>



<p>The turtle can execute a number of other commands, in addition to
<font color="#007000">forward</font>,
<font color="#007000">turn</font>, 
<font color="#007000">PenUp</font>,
<font color="#007000">PenDown</font>, 
<font color="#007000">clear</font>,
and <font color="#007000">home</font>.
Here are a few more basic commands.
In this list, x and y are parameters.  You can replace a
parameter with a number when you use the command.</p>

<UL>

<LI><font color="#007000">back(x)</font> tells
the turtle to back up x units, that is, to move x units in the
direction <strong>opposite</strong> to its current heading.
For example, <font color="#007000">back(3)</font> tells the
turtle to back up three units.  Negative
numbers are allowed as parameters for both
<font color="#007000">forward</font> and <font color="#007000">back</font>.
<font color="#007000">Back(x)</font> is provided only
as a convenient shorthand for <font color="#007000">forward(-x)</font>.

<LI><font color="#007000">face(x)</font> 
makes the turtle turn to a heading of x
degrees from heading zero.  For example, <font color="#007000">face(90)</font> points
the turtle straight up, <font color="#007000">face(-90)</font> points it straight down, 
and <font color="#007000">face(180)</font>
points it to the left.  Note the distinction between
<font color="#007000">turn</font> and <font color="#007000">face</font>: 
<font color="#007000">turn</font> specifies a change in
direction from the current heading, while
<font color="#007000">face</font> specifies a
new heading without any reference to whatever the old direction might
have been.

<LI><font color="#007000">moveTo(x,y)</font> 
tells the turtle to move from wherever it
happens to be, to the point with coordinates x and y.

<LI><font color="#007000">move(x,y)</font> 
is related to <font color="#007000">moveTo(x,y)</font> in the same
way that <font color="#007000">turn(x)</font> is related to <font color="#007000">face(x)</font>. 
That is, while <font color="#007000">moveTo(x,y)</font> says
&quot;move from the current location, whatever it is,
to the point with coordinates (x,y),&quot;
<font color="#007000">move(x,y)</font> says
&quot;move x units horizontally and y units vertically
<strong>from the current location</strong>.&quot;
Note that these commands do not depend upon or change the heading
of the turtle.

<LI><font color="#007000">circle(x)</font> 
draws a circle of radius x.  You should think of
the turtle moving in a circle starting from its current position and
returning to that position at the end.  Note that the turtle position
is <strong>on</strong> the circle. 
If x is positive, the turtle curves to its left as it
draws the circle, and the center of the circle is x units to the
left of the original turtle position.  If x is negative, the turtle
curves to the right, and the center of the circle is to the right of
the original position.

<LI><font color="#007000">arc(x,y)</font> 
draws part of a circle of radius x.  A full circle
would be 360 degrees; <font color="#007000">arc(x,y)</font>
draws an arc of y degrees.
As with <font color="#007000">circle(x)</font>,
the turtle curves to the left if x is
positive and to the right if x is negative.  If y is negative
then the turtle will &quot;back up&quot; along an arc.
Note that the turtle changes position and heading as it draws.

<LI><font color="#007000">HideTurtle</font> and
<font color="#007000">ShowTurtle</font> make the turtle (the small
black triangle) invisible and visible.  The turtle can still draw while
it is invisible.  (There is a check-box labeled &quot;No Turtles&quot;
in the control strip to the right of the drawing area.
When this box is checked,
the turtle will always be invisible, <strong>regardless
</strong> of whether the program uses any <font color="#007000">HideTurtle</font>
or <font color="#007000">ShowTurtle</font> commands.)

</UL>


<p>Draw some pictures using these basic commands.
Here are a few things you can try, for example:</p>
<UL>
<LI><font color="#007000">circle(7) circle(5) circle(3) circle(1)</font>
<LI><font color="#007000">arc(5,90) arc(-5,-90) arc(5,90) arc(-5,-90)</font>
<LI><font color="#007000">forward(5) turn(120) forward(5) turn(120) forward(5)</font>
<LI><font color="#007000">forward(7) turn(90) forward(5) back(10)</font>
</UL>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="color">Color</A></font></H3>

<p>Unless you tell it to do otherwise, the turtle will draw
everything in red.  However, you can tell it to change its
drawing color to any other color.  The turtle understands
the following basic color commands:
<font color="#007000">red</font>,
<font color="#007000">blue</font>,
<font color="#007000">green</font>,
<font color="#007000">cyan</font>,
<font color="#007000">magenta</font>,
<font color="#007000">yellow</font>,
<font color="#007000">black</font>,
<font color="#007000">white</font>, and
<font color="#007000">gray</font>.  After it executes one
of these commands, it will draw in the specified color
until it comes to another color-change command.  For example,
the following sequence of commands will draw a triangle
with each side in a different color:</p>

<pre>            green forward(5) turn(120)
            blue  forward(5) turn(120)
            cyan  forward(5) turn(120)
</pre>

<p>Besides these basic color commands, there are two commands
that can be used to specify any drawing color that the
computer is capable of displaying.  The commands are
<font color="#007000">rgb(x,y,z)</font> and
<font color="#007000">hsb(x,y,z)</font>, where x, y, and z are
parameters that can have any value in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
To understand these commands, you need to know something about
color.  (But you can safely skip the details, if you want.)</p>

<p>Any color can be specified as some combination of
the <font color="#E70000">primary colors</font>,
red, green, and blue.  In the command <font color="#007000">rgb(x,y,z)</font>,
the parameters x, y, and z specify the amount of red,
green, and blue in the color.  For example, a value of zero for x
indicates that the color is to contain no red at all, and a value
of one for x means that the color contains the maximum possible
amount of red.  So, <font color="#007000">rgb(0,0,0)</font>
represents black, <font color="#007000">rgb(1,0,0)</font>
represents bright red, and <font color="#007000">rgb(0.5,0,0)</font>
is a darker red.  Some other examples: 
<font color="#007000">rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8)</font> is a very light gray,
<font color="#007000">rgb(1,0.6,0.6)</font> is pink, and
<font color="#007000">rgb(0,0.4,0.4)</font> is a dark blue-green.</p>

<p>The command <font color="#007000">hsb(x,y,z)</font> uses
an alternative method of specifying a color.  In this command,
x, y, and z represent <font color="#E70000">hue</font>,
<font color="#E70000">saturation</font>, and
<font color="#E70000">brightness</font>.  The hue is the
basic color: As x ranges from zero to one, the hue ranges
through the spectrum from red through orange, yellow, green
blue, violet, and back to red.  The meaning of the
brightness parameter is pretty clear, with a value of one
representing the brightest color of a given shade.  The
saturation can be thought of as follows:  A saturation value
of one gives the purest possible version of a color.
Decreasing the saturation from one towards zero is like
mixing paint of that color with gray paint of equal brightness.
The basic color remains the same, but it becomes &quot;diluted.&quot;</p>

<p>You'll find some examples of using the rgb and hsb
commands later in the lab.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="programs"></A>Writing xTurtle Programs</font></H3>

<p>The power of a computer comes from its ability to
execute programs.  The xTurtle applet allows you to write
and run programs.  Programs can include all the basic commands
described above.  They can also include loops, decisions,
subroutines, and other features.</p>

<p>The applet can be configured to load one or more programs
when it starts up.  The applet that you launched with the
button <A HREF="#launch">above</A> should have loaded several
sample programs that you will use in this lab.  You can also
write new programs from scratch.  You can select among the
programs that the applet knows about using the pop-up menu
at the very top of the applet.  You can begin a new program
by clicking on the &quot;New Program&quot; button, or by
choosing &quot;[New]&quot; from the pop-up menu.  (There
are also buttons for loading programs from files and for
saving programs to files; however, the configuration of your
Web browser might prevent these buttons from functioning.)</p>

<p>One of the sample programs for this lab is called
&quot;Necklace&quot;.  Select this program from the
pop-up menu at the top of the xTurtle applet.
This program contains an example of a <strong>loop</strong>.
The program itself reads:</p>

<pre>       PenUp
       moveTo(0,-5)
       PenDown
       LOOP
           arc(5,20)
           circle(-0.5)
           EXIT IF heading = 0
       END LOOP
</pre>

<p>In addition to these commands, the program contains a lot of
<font color="#E70000">comments</font>.
A comment is anything enclosed between braces,
{&nbsp;and&nbsp;}.  Comments are meant for human readers of
the program and are completely ignored by the computer.
You should read the comments on the sample program 
to help you understand what it does and how it works.</p>

<p>In an xTurtle program, a loop consists of the word
<font color="#007000">loop</font>,
then a sequence of instructions, then the words
<font color="#007000">end loop</font>.  One of 
the instructions must be an <font color="#007000">exit</font>
statement, which gives a
condition for ending the loop.  In the sample program,
the statement &quot;<font color="#007000">exit if
heading = 0</font>&quot; includes the condition
&quot;<font color="#007000">heading = 0</font>.  Since the
heading is the direction that the turtle is facing, this
condition is true when the turtle is facing
in the direction zero (that is, directly towards the right).</p>

<p>When a loop is executed, the computer will execute the
statements in the loop repeatedly.
Each time the <font color="#007000">exit</font> statement
is executed, the computer tests the
condition specified by that statement. If the condition is
satisfied, the computer jumps out of the loop.  (Ordinarily, after
exiting from a loop, the computer jumps to the statement that follows
the <font color="#007000">end loop</font>.  In this example, there is no further statement
after the loop, so the program ends when the loop ends.)</p>

<p>To run a program in the xTurtle program, select it from the
pop-up menu if necessary, so it is visible on the screen.
Then click on the &quot;Run Program&quot; button.  If there
are no errors in the program, the computer will switch back
to the drawing area and execute the program.  You can control
the rate of execution with the speed pop-up menu.  You can
pause the execution with the &quot;Pause&quot; button, and
you can terminate it permanently with the &quot;Stop&quot;
button.  After the program has been executed, you can run
it again by clicking the &quot;Run Program&quot; button.
Note that every time you run a program, the turtle starts
out in its initial configuration:  at the center of the
drawing area, facing right, with the pen down, and with
the drawing color set to red.</p>

<p>Run the Necklace program, and try to understand
how it works.  As another example, click on the &quot;New
Program&quot; button and then type in and run the following
program.  (Instead of typing it, you might want to
be clever and use cut-and-paste.)</p>

<pre>         DECLARE hue
         hue := 0
         LOOP
            hsb(hue,1,1)
            forward(5)
            back(5)
            turn(360/100)
            hue := hue + 0.01
            exit if hue = 1
         END LOOP
</pre>

<p>This program uses a <font color="#E70000">variable</font>
named &quot;hue&quot;.  (You can use any names you want
for variables, as long as you avoid words that already have
a special meaning, such as &quot;loop&quot; and &quot;if&quot;.)
A variable is just a memory location which has been
give a name and which can be
used to store a value.  In xTurtle, you give a name
to a memory location
with a <font color="#007000">declare</font> statement.
Once you have declared a variable, you can store
a value in it with an <font color="#E70000">assignment
statement</font>, which has the form</p>

<pre>           &lt;variable-name&gt;  :=  &lt;value&gt;
</pre>

<p>The operator := is called the <font color="#E70000">assignment
operator</font>.  It tells the computer to calculate the
value on the right and to store it into the variable on
the left.  The value on the right can be given as a number,
as another variable, or as a mathematical formula.  For example:</p>

<pre>           hue := hue + 0.01
           x := 17
           newAmount := oldAmount
           cost := length * width * costPerSquareFoot
</pre>

<p>Next, we turn to an example that introduces the
<font color="#E70000">if statement</font>.  This is the
sample program &quot;RandomWalk&quot;, which should
already be loaded into the xTurtle applet.  Select the
&quot;RandomWalk&quot; program from the pop-up menu
and run the program several times.
This program makes the turtle do a &quot;random walk&quot;
in which it  repeatedly moves in a randomly chosen direction.
Read the program and the comments on it, and try to understand
how it works.</p>

<p>In particular, look at the if statement in the Random
Walk program.  An if statement is used to decide among alternative
courses of action.  An if statement begins with the word
<font color="#007000">if</font> and ends with
the words <font color="#007000">end if</font>.  (The 
&quot;end if&quot; here is not a separate command; it is merely
a required syntactic marker to mark the end of the if statement.
It is very different from an &quot;exit if&quot; statement,
and you should try not to confuse them.)
The exact rules for using if statements
are rather complicated, and are covered in
<cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite> and in the
detailed on-line <A HREF="../xTurtle/info.html">information</A> about
xTurtle.  However,
you should be able to get the basic idea by looking at the example
in the sample program.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="io">Interacting with the User</A></font></H3>


<p>Any real programming language needs to provide
some way for a program to communicate with the person who is using
the program.  The xTurtle programming language provides only minimal
support for input and output, but what it provides is enough for a
program to have a simple dialog with the user.</p>

<p>There are two commands for <font color="#E70000">output</font>
(sending information from the computer
to the user), and one command for <font color="#E70000">input</font>
(getting information from the
user into the computer).  All of these commands use
<font color="#E70000">strings</font>. A string
is sequences of characters enclosed in quotes, such as:
<tt>&quot;Hello&quot;</tt>.  The command</p>
 
<pre>               DrawText(&quot;Hello&quot;)
</pre>

<p>will print the string <tt>Hello</tt> in the drawing area at
the current turtle position.  (Note that the quotes are 
<strong>not</strong> of the string that is displayed.  The
quotes are just there in the program to tell the computer that
this is a string.)</p>

<p>The command</p>

<pre>               TellUser(&quot;Hello&quot;)
</pre>

<p>will display {\tt Hello} in a little green-colored box
in the center of the display area.  There
will also be a button labeled &quot;OK&quot;.
The user reads the string and then clicks on the OK
button to get rid of the box.
The <font color="#007000">TellUser</font> command
has no permanent effect on the picture in the drawing area.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the more complicated input command,
<font color="#007000">AskUser</font>. This command allows
the user to enter a number; the number entered by the user
will be stored in a variable.  The variable must, of course,
be declared before it can be used in this command.
For example, assuming that a variable named
&quot;<font color="#007000">betAmount</font>&quot; has been declared, the command</p>

<pre>               AskUser(&quot;How much do you want to bet?&quot;, betAmount)
</pre>

<p>will display a box containing the string
&quot;How much do you want to 
bet?&quot; along with a
text-input box where the user can enter a response.
The number entered by the user will be stored in the
variable <font color="#007000">betAmount</font>, and the
program can then use that number by referring to the
variable.</p>

<p>All of the input/output commands have a
nice feature that allows you to include the value
of a variable in a string.  If a string includes the special
character #, then that # must be followed by
the name of a variable.  When the
string is displayed, the # and the name will
be replaced by the value of the variable.
For example, if <font color="#007000">betAmount</font> and
<font color="#007000">winnings</font> are variables
with the values 25 and 75, then

<pre>              TellUser(&quot;You bet #betAmount dollars; you win $#winnings.&quot;)
</pre>

<p>would display the string: <tt>You bet 25 dollars; you
win $75.</tt></p>


<p>All of this is illustrated in the sample program
&quot;InputOutputExample&quot;.
You should select this program from the pop-up menu, read it,
run it, and try to understand it.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="exercises">Exercises</A></font></H3>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>
Find a sequence of xTurtle commands to draw each of
the following:  a square with a circle inside it;
a pair of parallel lines connected by half-circles
at each end; a plus sign.  The pictures should
look something like this:

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>
For this exercise, experiment with the &quot;Necklace&quot;
sample program.  The original program draws a large circle
of radius 5, made up of a sequence of 20-degree arcs.
Between each pair of arcs, another small circle is added
as decoration.  You can try changing the size of the
arcs in the large circle.  For example, change the &quot;20&quot;
to &quot;3&quot; and you'll get a decoration every 3 degrees
instead of every 20 degrees.   You could also change
the radius in the arc command.  You can try using a different
decoration.  For example, try changing 
<font color="#007000">circle(-0.5)</font> to
<font color="#007000">forward(5) back(5)</font>.
You could be more creative.  Try using a triangle or
a square as decoration.  (Whatever commands you use to
draw the decoration, you should be sure that they return
the turtle to the same position and heading as when
it starts.)  Try to find the prettiest variation on the 
&quot;necklace&quot; theme that you can find.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
The following program was used as an example earlier in
the lab.  It draws 100 lines radiating out from a central
point.  Each line is drawn with a different &quot;hue,&quot;,
and the colors of the lines range throughout the entire
spectrum.</p>


<pre>         DECLARE hue
         hue := 0
         LOOP
            hsb(hue,1,1)
            forward(5)
            back(5)
            turn(360/100)
            hue := hue + 0.01
            exit if hue = 1
         END LOOP
</pre>

<p>How would you modify this program so that, instead of
changing the hue from one line to the next, you change
the saturation instead?  What does the resulting picture
look like?  (Try it and find out!)
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>
The word <font color="#007000">random</font> can be used
in a program to represent a random value in the range
from 0.0 to 1.0.  (<font color="#007000">Random</font>
is actually a function with no parameters, but it acts
like a variable that has a different value each time it
is used.)  What happens if you substitute the 
command <font color="#007000">rgb(random,random,random)</font>
for the command <font color="#007000">hsb(hue,1,1)</font>
in the program from Exercise 4?  Why?  Explain carefully
what the modified program does.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
Modify the &quot;RandomWalk&quot; sample program so
that each line is a different, randomly chosen color.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>
In the &quot;RandomWalk&quot; sample program, the computer
chooses one of the <strong>four</strong> directions 0, 90, -90 and 180 at random.
Modify the program so that it chooses one of the <strong>three</strong>
directions 0, 120 and -120 instead.  It should have an equal chance of choosing
any of these directions.  Make sure that you test your program!
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font>
Write a program that can draw a square in any of
three different colors.  It should let the user of the
program decide which color to use.  Ask the user to
&quot;Enter 0 for red, 1 for blue, and 2 for green.&quot;
If the user enters an invalid response, you should display
an error message instead of a square.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font>
With what you have learned in this lab, you
can write a simple guessing game program (which will use none of the
graphical capabilities of xTurtle).  Write a program in which the
computer chooses a random integer between 1 and 100, and the user
tries to guess the number.  Each time the user makes a guess, the 
computer should (honestly) tell the user &quot;Sorry, your guess is too high,&quot;
&quot;Sorry, your guess is too low&quot; or &quot;You got it.&quot;
Although this program does something completely different from the
random walk sample program, nevertheless it is similar in general
outline.  In particular, you will use an if statement inside
a loop.  Use a loop
to allow for repeated guesses.  The loop will end when the user guesses
correctly.  Your program can begin the following three
lines, before the loop:</p>

<pre>        DECLARE answer
        DECLARE guess
        answer := randomInt(100)
</pre>

<p>Your program should include comments.  Like the sample programs,
it should use indentation to show the structure of the program.
(The &quot;Indent&quot; button can be used to
automatically indent a program; this feature is also useful for
finding certain types of errors in a program, such as a missing
<font color="#007000">end if</font>.)</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 10:</b></font>
This exercise assumes that you have completed Exercise 9
successfully.  Improve the program from that exercise so
that after each game, it will give the user the option of
playing again.  You will need to add <strong>another</strong>
loop to the program, containing the loop that already exists.
You will also need to know a new command.  The 
<font color="#007000">YesOrNo</font> command can
be used to ask the user a yes-or-no question.  Specifically,
the command</p>

<pre>           YesOrNo(&quot;Do you want to play another game?&quot;, response)
</pre>

<p>will ask the user the given question. It will store a zero
in the variable <font color="#007000">response</font> if the user answers
no and will store a one in that variable if the user answers yes.
The outer loop should continue until the value of the
response is zero.
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 11:</b></font>
You have probably already discovered that the computer
can display <font color="#E70000">error messages</font>
if you try to run a program that contains an error.
Errors that the computer can find before actually running
the program are called <font color="#E70000">syntax
errors</font>.  The following program contains several
syntax errors.  Find each error and explain what is
wrong in each case.  (You can type in the program and
let the computer find the errors.)</p>

<pre>          DECLARE length
          length = 8
          LOOP
             forward length
             turn(90)
             length := length - 1
             EXIT IF length equals 0
          END LOOP
</pre>

<p>Some errors can only be found when a program is running.
For example, what error occurs when the following program is
run?  (Type it in and find out!)</p>

<pre>        DECLARE sum, count
        sum := 0
        count := 0
        LOOP
           sum := sum + 1/count
           count := count + 1
           EXIT IF count = 10
        END LOOP
        DrawText(&quot;The sum is #sum.&quot;)
</pre>

<p>There is a third -- and much worse -- type of error,
which occurs when the program gives an incorrect result
but the computer gives you no warning of the fact that
the answer is wrong.  Give an example of such an error.
Explain why the computer cannot detect such
&quot;wrong-answer errors.&quot;
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 12:</b></font>
This exercise assumes that you are familiar with
the &quot;xComputer&quot; model computer, which is
used in some other labs.  Write a short essay comparing the
assembly language of xComputer with the high-level 
programming language, xTurtle.
For example, you could:  compare the way loops are constructed in
each language; compare labels in assembly language to variables
in xTurtle; and compare the way computations are done in assembly
language with the way they are done by assignment statements in
xTurtle.
