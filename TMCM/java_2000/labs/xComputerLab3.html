         Subroutines</font></H2>

<hr alignt=center width="50%">

<p><font size="+2">A </font>SUBROUTINE IS A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS for performing some
task, chunked together and thought of as a unit.  Like loops and
decisions, subroutines are useful in the construction of complex
programs.  The machine language for xComputer does not provide
direct support for subroutines.  But then again, it doesn't
really provide direct support for loops and decisions, which
must be implemented by the programmer with jump and conditional
jump instructions.  Similarly, it is possible to implement
subroutines using jump instructions.  They are not as easy, as
neat, or as safe as subroutines in a high-level language, but
they can still be a useful tool.  Furthermore, by working with
subroutines on xComputer, you'll get to see some of the details
of how subroutines can be implemented on a very low level.
(You should understand, though, that the machine languages
of real computers do provide more support for subroutines
than what is covered here.)</p>

<p>Before doing this lab, you should be very familiar with the
xComputer applet and with assembly language programming for
xComputer, as covered in <a href="xComputerLab1.html">xComputerLab 1</a>
and <a href="xComputerLab2.html">xComputer Lab 2</a>.  The material

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="calling">There and Back Again</A></font></H3>

<p>The idea of subroutines is simple enough.  A subroutine is just
a sequence of instructions that performs some specific task.
Whenever a program needs to perform that task, it can <font color="#E70000">call</font>
the subroutine to do so.  The subroutine only has to be written once,
and once it is written, you can forget about the details of how it
works.  If the same task needs to be performed in another program,
then it can simply be copied from one program to another
using cut-and-paste .  So the work done on writing the subroutine doesn't have
to be repeated over and over.  The subroutine can be <font color="E70000">reused</font>.
In fact, real computers have large <font color="E70000">libraries</font>
of subroutines that are available for use by programs.  The complex programs
that are used on modern computers would be extremely difficult to write,
if these libraries of pre-written subroutines were not available.</p>

<p>In xComputer's assembly language, &quot;calling&quot; a subroutine
means jumping to the first instruction in the subroutine, using
a JMP instruction.  The execution of the subroutine will end with
a jump back to the same point in the program from which the subroutine was
called, so that the program can pick up where it left off before calling the
subroutine.
This is known as <font color="E70000">returning</font> from the subroutine.
(Other computers provide special commands for calling and returning
from subroutines.)</p>

<p>There is more to it than a few jump instructions, though.
For one thing, if the subroutine is to be reusable in a meaningful
sense, it must be possible to call the subroutine from many
different places in a program.  If this is the case, how does the
computer know what point in the program to return to when the 
subroutine ends?  The answer is that the return point has to be
recorded somewhere before the subroutine is called.  The address in
memory to which the computer is supposed to return after the subroutine
ends is called the <font color="#E70000">return address</font>.  Before
jumping to the start of the subroutine, the program must store
the return address in a place where the subroutine can find it.
When the subroutine has finished performing its assigned task, it
ends with a jump back to the return address. If, for example,
the return address has been stored in a memory location labeled
&quot;<tt>RetAddr</tt>&quot;, then the subroutine can finish with
the statement:</p>

<pre>                  JMP-I  RetAddr
</pre>

<p>In the language of xComputer, <tt>JMP-I</tt> is an 
<font color="#E70000">indirect jump</font> instruction, which
uses indirect addressing.  It tells the computer to jump to the
location whose address is stored in <tt>RetAddr</tt>.  In this
case, that will be the return address for the subroutine.</p>

<p>All of the subroutines that you will work with in this lab
use return addresses in the same way.  A memory location in the
subroutine is reserved for holding the return address.  Before
jumping to the beginning of the subroutine, the program will
save the appropriate address in that memory location.  The
subroutine ends with an indirect jump instruction to the return
address.</p>

<p>As a first example, look at the sample program &quot;MultiplyBySeven.txt&quot;
This program uses a very simple subroutine whose task is to multiply a
number by seven.  The subroutine, which is named <tt>Times7</tt>, is
at the end of the program.  It begins with the lines:</p>

<pre>        RetAddr:  data          ; The return address for the subroutine must
                                ;    be stored in this location before the
                                ;    subroutine is called.

        Times7:   STO num_t     ; STARTING POINT OF SUBROUTINE.
</pre>

<p>The first line reserves a memory location to hold the return address.
The &quot;main program,&quot; which uses the subroutine, stores the
return address in this memory location.  It then jumps to the location
&quot;Times7&quot;, which is where the instructions for the subroutine
begin.  The last instruction in the subroutine is &quot;<tt>JMP-I RetAddr</tt>&quot;
which returns control back to the main program.</p>

<p>The return address is not the only item of information that the
program has to send to the subroutine.  The task of the subroutine is
to multiply a number by seven.  The main program has to tell the
subroutine <b>which</b> number to multiply by seven.  This information
is said to be a <font color="#E70000">parameter</font> of the subroutine.
Similarly, the subroutine has to get its answer -- the result of multiplying
the parameter value by seven -- back to the main program.  This answer
is called the <font color="#E70000">return value</font> of the subroutine.
In &quot;MultiplyBySeven.txt,&quot; the program puts the parameter
value in the accumulator before calling the subroutine.  The subroutine
knows to look for it there.  Before it jumps back to the main program,
the subroutine puts its return value in the accumulator.  The main
program knows to look for it there.  Passing parameter values and
return values back and forth in a register, such as the accumulator,
is a very simple and efficient method of communication between a
subroutine and the rest of a program.  In the next section, we'll look
at other methods of communication.</p>

<p>You should read the &quot;MultiplyBySeven.txt&quot; sample program
and be sure you understand it.  Load it into memory with the &quot;Translate&quot;
button and execute it.  You might want to execute it by hand with the
&quot;Cycle&quot; button so that you can follow in detail how it works.
Modify the program so that it computes 103*7 instead of 34*7.
(Would you have thought of multiplying a number by seven using the method
in this subroutine?  Of course, a major point about subroutines is that
when you are using a subroutine that someone else has written for you,
you don't really care so much <b>how</b>
it performs its task, as long as it does it correctly.  You use the
subroutine as a &quot;<font color="#E70000">black box</font>.&quot;)</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="params">Parameters and Local Names</A></font></H3>

<p>It is not always possible to pass parameter values in registers.  In xComputer,
for example, there is only register (the accumulator) that can be used for
parameter-passing.  But some subroutines require two or more parameters.
The solution is to use reserved memory locations for the parameter
values, just as is done for the subroutine's return address.  Similarly,
a return value from a subroutine can be placed in a reserved memory location
rather than in a register.  This method is a little more difficult than
using registers, but it is also more flexible.</p>

<p>Look at the sample program &quot;MultiplyTwoNumbers.txt.&quot;  This
sample program includes a subroutine that can multiply any two numbers.
The numbers that are to be multiplied are parameters to the subroutine,
and the product of the two numbers is its return value.  The memory
locations labeled <tt>N1</tt>, <tt>N2</tt>, and <tt>Answer</tt> are used
to hold the two parameter values and the return value.  These locations
can be found at the beginning of the subroutine, along with a memory
location to hold the return address.  Before it calls the subroutine,
the main program must load the two numbers that it wants to multiply
into <tt>N1</tt> and <tt>N2</tt>.  When the subroutine ends, the
main program can get the answer by loading the contents of memory
location <tt>Answer</tt>  You should read the program, try it out,
and make sure that you understand all this.  The program contains a list of
detailed instructions for using the subroutine.  (Note that you don't
have to understand the method that the subroutine uses for multiplying
the numbers.  In fact, it's a fairly complex procedure.)</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p>By the way, when you read the &quot;Multiply&quot; subroutine, you'll notice that
it uses nine different labeled memory locations.  Five of these --
<tt>ret_addr</tt>, <tt>N1</tt>, <tt>N2</tt>, <tt>Answer</tt>, and <tt>Multiply</tt> --
are used for communication with the main program.  The other four are part of
the internal working of the subroutine.  Ideally, the main program wouldn't
have to know about them at all, because the main program is only interested
in the task performed by the subroutine, not in its internal workings.
These labels are called <font color="#e70000">local</font> names,
since they are meant to be used only &quot;locally&quot; inside the
subroutine.  Unfortunately, in the simple assembly language of xComputer,
it is not possible to actually &quot;hide&quot; these names from the
main program, and you have to be careful not to use the same name
for a different purpose in the main program.  In my sample subroutines,
I have tried to use local names that are not likely to occur elsewhere
in the program, such as <tt>loop_m</tt> and <tt>done_m</tt>.
In real programming languages, local names are actually invisible to
the rest of the program, so there is no possibility of a conflict.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="pointers">Passing Pointers</A></font></H3>

<p>The final sample program, &quot;ListSumSubroutine.txt,&quot;
illustrates one more aspect of parameter passing.  The subroutine in
this example is meant to add up an entire list of numbers.  There is
no limit placed on the number of items in the list.  How is it possible
to pass a potentially limitless number of parameters to the subroutine?</p>

<p>The solution is that the numbers in the list are not passed to the
subroutine at all!  Instead, the main program tells the subroutine
<b>where in memory</b> to look for the list.  There is only one
parameter: the address of the starting location of the list.
This address is said to be a <font color="#E70000">pointer</font>
to the list.</p>

<p>In the &quot;ListSumSubroutine.txt&quot; example, the main program
stores a pointer to the list in the memory location labeled
&quot;ListStart.&quot;  The subroutine then accesses the numbers
in the list using indirect addressing (in a <tt>LOD-I</tt> instruction).
This is a nice example that demonstrates once again the usefulness of
pointers and indirect addressing.</p>



<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="reality">Reality Check</A></font></H3>

<p>It's actually kind of crazy to try to write subroutines for xComputer.
The limited variety of machine language instructions for xComputer makes
it very hard to express the idea of a subroutine in that language.
Not surprisingly, real computers have special-purpose machine language
instructions for working with subroutines.</p>

<p>The first thing that a machine language needs is a pair of instructions
for calling a subroutine and for returning from a subroutine.  These
instructions might be called <font color="#E70000">jump-to-subroutine</font>
and <font color="#E70000">return-from-subroutine</font>.  The
jump-to-subroutine instruction would automatically save a return address
and then jump to the starting point of the subroutine.  The computer could
figure out the return address on its own -- instead of leaving it up to
the programmer -- by looking at the value in the Program Counter register.
(The Program Counter holds the address of the <b>next</b> instruction
after the one that is currently being executed, and that's exactly the
point that the subroutine should jump back to.)  The
return-from-subroutine instruction would get the return address that
was previously saved by jump-to-subroutine and jump back to that address.
These two instructions would make it unnecessary for a programmer
to even think about return addresses.</p>

<p>Real computers also have a more systematic way of dealing with
parameters.  An area of memory called the <font color="#E70000">stack</font>
is used to hold the parameters for <b>all</b> subroutines.  In fact,
the stack also holds return addresses and data values used internally
by subroutines.  The stack is just a list of values.  When a subroutine
is called, the parameters and return address for the subroutine are
added to the end of the list.  When the subroutine ends, the return
address and parameters are removed from the stack.  The jump-to-subroutine
instruction stores the return address on the stack, and
return-from-subroutine removes it from the stack when it's time for
the subroutine to end.  Typically, a computer has a register called
the <font color="#E70000">Stack Pointer</font> to keep track of
how big the stack currently is.  And machine language typically includes
instructions called <font color="#E70000">push</font> and
<font color="#E70000">pop</font> to add items from the stack and to
remove items from the end of the stack.</p>

<p>When one subroutine calls another, all the data for the second
subroutine is simply added to the stack, on &quot;top&quot; of the
data that is already there.  When the second subroutine ends, its
data is removed from the stack, but the data for the first subroutine
is still there so that the first subroutine can simply pick up where
it left off.  The whole system is really rather elegant.</p>

<p>Maybe it's not so crazy to write a few subroutines for xComputer
after all, since doing everything by hand can help you understand
what really goes on when a subroutine is called.  And it can also
help you appreciate the elegance of more sophisticated computers
and programming languages.</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>
The main program in the &quot;MultiplyTwoNumbers.txt&quot;
sample program is as follows: 
</p>
<pre>           lod-c 13         ; Set up to call the subroutine with
           sto N1           ;   N1 = 13, N2 = 56, and ret_addr = back.
           lod-c 56
           sto N2
           lod-c back
           sto ret_addr
           jmp Multiply     ; Call the subroutine.
      
     back: lod Answer       ; When the subroutine ends, it returns
                            ;    control to this location, and the
                            ;    product of N1 and N2 is in Answer.
                            ;    This LOD instruction puts the answer
                            ;    in the accumulator.

           hlt              ; Terminate the program by halting the computer.
</pre>

<p>Carefully explain each instruction in this program.  Explain exactly
what each of the first 8 instructions has to do with calling the
subroutine.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>
Write a main program that uses the <tt>Multiply</tt> subroutine
in &quot;MultiplyTwoNumbers.txt&quot; to compute the product
5 * 23 * 17.  Do not modify the subroutine.  The main program should
call the subroutine <b>twice</b>.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>
Write a subroutine to add three numbers.
(This is a pretty silly thing to do, but the point is to demonstrate
that you understand the basic concepts involved.)  Your subroutine
should have three parameters and a return value  (the three numbers to be added and
their sum).  Write a main program that uses your subroutine to
add 17, 42, and 105.  Your program will be very similar to
the sample program &quot;MultiplyTwoNumbers.txt.&quot;  Make sure
to include comments in your program!
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
Read the <a href="#reality">Reality Check</a> section above.
Why can't you express the jump-to-subroutine and return-from-subroutine
operations in the language of xComputer?  What do these
instructions need to do that can't be expressed in that language?
What sort of modifications would have to be made to xComputer to add them
to xComputer's machine language?
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>
The sample program &quot;ListSumSubroutine.txt&quot; uses a subroutine
to add up a list of numbers.  Suppose you would like to multiply the
numbers instead.  To do this, copy the multiplication subroutine
from the &quot;MultiplyTwoNumbers.txt&quot; sample program, and
paste it onto the end of &quot;ListSumSubroutine.txt.&quot;
Modify the <tt>ListSum</tt> subroutine so that instead of adding
two numbers, it uses the <tt>Multiply</tt> subroutine to multiply.
You have to replace the instruction &quot;<tt>add Sum</tt>&quot;
with several instructions that set up a call to the <tt>Multiply</tt>
subroutine.  And you'll need to make up a return address label for
the subroutine to jump back to.  Once you've made this modification,
the program will compute the product 1*2*3*4*5*6*7 instead of the sum
1+2+3+4+5+6+7.  (You might want to change the name of the
subroutine from <tt>ListSum</tt> to <tt>ListMul</tt>, and change
the name of the memory location <tt>Sum</tt> to <tt>Product</tt>.
This will require that you also change the names in the main program.)
</p>



<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
The sample file &quot;PrimesAndRemainders.txt&quot; defines two subroutines.
One of the subroutines can be used to find the remainder when one integer
is divided into another.  The other subroutine can be used to determine
whether a number is prime.  The file does not contain a main program.
If you want to use one or both of the subroutines, you can add a main
program at the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>You should read the comments on the two subroutines
to find out how to use them.  Then write two programs that use the
subroutines.  The first program should use the &quot;Remainder&quot;
subroutine to compute the remainder when 609 is divided by 81.  
The second program should use the &quot;PrimeTest&quot; subroutine
to determine whether or not 51 is prime.  Note that you do <b>not</b>
have to understand how the subroutines work.  You just need to 
know how to call them and pass the proper parameters to them.</p>



<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>
This exercise, like the previous one, involves writing a main program
for the &quot;PrimesAndRemainders.txt&quot; example.  However, this
exercise is much more challenging.  Write a main program that makes
a list of prime numbers.  The program should use the &quot;PrimeTest&quot;
subroutine to test whether each of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on,
is prime.  Each number that is found to be prime should be added to a
list.  You can write a program that runs in an infinite loop.
</p>

<p>Use a location named &quot;p&quot; to store the number that you are checking.
Start by storing a 2 in p.  In a loop, you should call PrimeTest to
see whether p is prime.  If p is prime, then add it to the list.
In any case, you should then add 1 to p and jump back to the start of
the loop to test the next value of p.</p>

<p>Making a list of primes means storing primes in consecutive memory 
locations.  Use a location named &quot;<tt>list</tt>&quot; to point to the end of
the list.  That is, the value of <tt>list</tt> is the location where
you want to store the next prime that you find.  Let's say that you want
the list of primes to begin at location 50.  At the beginning of the
program, you should store a 50 in <tt>list</tt>.  When you find a
prime number, you can add it to the end of the list with a
<tt>STO-I list</tt> command.  Then you should add 1 to the value of list
to get ready for the next number.</p>

<p>If you run your program at high speed, you can watch it store the
numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on in memory.  You might want to
watch the program in graphics mode so that you can watch the activity
in the main program and in the two subroutines.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font>
Write a short essay discussing how subroutines can
make it easier to design and write complex programs.
(Your answer should show that you understand that they can do
more than save you typing!)  In your essay, use some of the work
you did in this lab for examples.</p>
