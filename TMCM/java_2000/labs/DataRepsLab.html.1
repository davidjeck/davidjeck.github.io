         The Web, Java, and DataReps</font></H2>

<hr alignt=center width="50%">

<p><font size="+1">T</font>HIS IS THE FIRST in a set of lab worksheets
meant to be used with the introductory computer science textbook,
<cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>.  The lab worksheets are written
for use on the <font color="#E70000">World-Wide Web</font>, and they
make use of software written in the form of <font color="#E70000">applets</font>.
Applets are computer programs written in a new programming language called
<font color="#E70000">Java</font>.  All this is explained in the lab,
which acts as an introduction to the Web and an orientation to the
way applets will be used in the rest of the lab.</p>

As part of the lab, you will use an applet called &quot;DataReps&quot; 
to help you learn about how different types of data can be represented
using binary numbers. This material is related to Section 1.1 of the
text.</p>

<p>(For a full list of labs and applets, see the <A HREF="../index.html">index page</A>.)</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="web">The World-Wide Web</A></font></H3>

<p>The <font color="#E70000">Internet</font> consists of millions of
computers around the world, linked together by a network so that
they -- and their users -- can communicate and interact.
In the last few years, the Internet has become a common part of
everyday life for many people.  The Internet provides a number of useful
services, including e-mail, USENET news groups, and the World-Wide Web.
This section of the lab is a brief introduction to the Web.</p>

<p>The <font color="#E70000">World-Wide Web</font>, also known as the
WWW or simply as the Web, consists of &quot;pages&quot; of information 
stored on computers all around the world.  These pages are available to
anyone with a connection to the Internet.  They viewed with
a <font color="#E70000">Web browser</font> such as Netscape or
Internet Explorer.  A page can contain text, pictures, sounds, three-D
graphics, movies, applets, and even interactive features such as fill-in forms.
Most important, a page can contain <font color="#E70000">links</font>
to other pages.  When you click on a link, the Web browser will fetch the
page that it refers to and display it to you.  So, it's pretty easy to use the
Web:  just point your mouse at a link, and click!  Here, for example,
are some <A NAME="links">links</A> to pages you might want to visit:</p>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.abcnews.com">ABC News</A>, <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com">Cable Network News</A>,

</UL>

<p>The Web is huge, and it has information on almost anything
you can think of.  There are millions of computers on the Internet.
Each of those computers can run a &quot;Web site&quot; and publish Web
pages.  No one controls this; no one has to authorize it (at least not
yet).  In fact, you can publish your own information on the Web.
One of the later labs will deal with this.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="url">URL's and All That</A></font></H3>

<p>Every page of information on the Web is identified by a
<font color="#E70000">URL</font> (Uniform Resource Locator).
Other resources, such as pictures and sounds, are also identified
by URL's.  When you are viewing a page with a Web browser, the URL of
that page is usually displayed in a box near the top of the browser's
display window.  If you know the URL for a page, you can go directly
to that page by entering the URL in that box (and pressing return).</p>

<p>A typical URL is http://math.hws.edu/TMCM/java/index.html.  This is
the URL for a page that describes all the labs and applets that I have
written for use with <cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>.  This URL has
several meaningful parts:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/Intro1.gif" WIDTH="555" HEIGHT="156"></p>

<p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the most common method
used for communication on the Web.  Another common protocol is
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), an older method for transferring files
from one computer to another.  You might also run across some other
protocols in URL's.</p>

<p>A domain name, such as math.hws.edu, identifies a particular computer
on the Internet.  Most of the computers that are used as &quot;servers&quot;
of data on the Web have domain names that begin with &quot;www&quot;,
such as www.whitehouse.gov.  You can often read some information about
a computer from its domain name.  The computer named math.hws.edu is
in the Mathematics Department (&quot;math&quot;) at
Hobart and William Smith Colleges (&quot;hws&quot;), which is
an educational institution (&quot;edu&quot;).  The last part of
the domain name, such as &quot;gov&quot; or &quot;edu&quot;
is called the <font color="#E70000">top-level domain</font>.  Top-level
domains include:</p>

<UL>
<LI>COM for commercial purposes
<LI>EDU for educational institutions
<LI>GOV for government computers
<LI>MIL for the military 
<LI>ORG for other organizations
<LI>NET for certain Internet services
</UL>

<p>These domains are usually used by computers in the United States.
Computers in other countries generally use two-letter country codes
for their top-level domains.  For example, a domain name ending in
&quot;it&quot; indicates a computer in Italy, and &quot;ca&quot; is
used by Canadian computers.</p>

<p>Many companies, organizations, and institutions have &quot;home pages&quot;
on the Web.  If you know something about domain names, you can often guess
the URL used by a given company, organization, or institution.
For example, you might guess that the home page of the United States
Senate is http://www.senate.gov or that the Coca-Cola corporation 
has a home page at http://www.cocacola.com.  (When you use a URL
that omits the directory and file name, you will usually get the
home page, or index page, from the specified computer.)</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="search">Searching the Web</A></font></H3>

<p>Because there is so much information on the Web, finding what you want
can be a problem.  There are several utilities that can help you to find
things on the Web.  First of all, there are &quot;hierarchical indices&quot;
that list Web sites according to category.  One of the largest of these
indices is <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>.</p>

<p>Another way to find things on the Web is to use a &quot;search engine.&quot;
A search engine consists of an index of millions of Web pages and a program
for searching the index.  (The index is made by a program that constantly
downloads Web pages and adds their contents to the index.  <b>No</b> index
can include all the data on the Web because the Web grows so quickly.  Also,
some of the data in an index will be out of date because people change
or delete their Web pages.)</p>

<p>To use an index, all you have to do is type some words into a box and 
click on a button.  (You can do more advanced searches, but most search
engines allow you to do simple searches in this way.)  You'll get back a list 
of Web pages that contain the words you entered.  Here, for example, is a
simple interface to the Alta Vista search engine.  To try it, click in the
input box, type some words, and the click the Submit button:</p>

<blockquote>
<FORM method=GET action="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query">
<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=pg VALUE=q>
<strong>Search </strong><SELECT NAME=what><OPTION VALUE=web SELECTED>the Web<OPTION VALUE=news>Usenet</SELECT><strong><br>
and Display the Results</strong>
<SELECT NAME=fmt><OPTION VALUE="." SELECTED>in Standard Form<OPTION VALUE=c>in Compact Form<OPTION VALUE=d>in Detailed Form</SELECT>
<br>
<INPUT NAME=q size=45 maxlength=200 VALUE="">
<INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE=Submit><br>
</FORM>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many search engines, including
<a href="http://www.altavista.digital.com">Alta Vista</a>,
<a href="http://www.webcrawler.com">WebCrawler</a>,
<a href="http://www.lycos.com">Lycos</a>,
<a href="http://www.excite.com">Excite</a>,
and <a href="http://www.infoseek.com">Infoseek</a>.
You will have to use at least one of these search engines in order
to do some of the exercises at the end of the lab.  To get the 
most out of a search engine, you should read its help or instructions
page.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="java">Java and Applets</A></font></H3>

<p>The example of the search engines shows that a Web page can be more
than just a passive collection of links.  A Web page can also be
<font color="#E70000">interactive</font>.  The Alta Vista search engine
uses a type of interaction known as a <font color="#E70000">form</font>
(or &quot;fill-in form&quot;).  You enter some data in the form and
click on a submit button.  Your Web browser sends your data to
another computer, which responds to your data by sending a new page
for your Web browser to display.</p>  

<p>Web pages can also provide other types of interactivity, without
involving a second computer.
One of the new technologies on the Web is <font color="#E70000">Java</font>,
a programming language that can be used to write <font color="#E70000">applets</font>,
which are small programs that run on a Web page.  Many Java applets are
more decorative than useful, like this &quot;Moir&eacute;&quot; applet:</p>

<p align=center>
<applet code="Moire1.class" 
              alt="(Java not enabled.)" height=200 width=200>
   <param name="bgColor" value="yellow">
   <param name="lineColor" value="0 180 0">
   <font color="#E70000">(Sorry, your browser doesn't do Java!)</font>
</applet>
</p>

<p>(A Moir&eacute; pattern is formed by the &quot;interference&quot;
between two similar patterns.  In this applet, the basic pattern consists of
lines radiating out from a command center.  There are two copies of this
pattern.  One is fixed, while the other drifts about.)

<p>Even this decorative applet allows some interaction.  If you 
click-and-drag your mouse on the Moir&eacute; applet, you can control
the motion of the pattern.  (To &quot;click-and-drag&quot; means to
press the mouse button and then move the mouse, while holding down
the button.)  If you shift-click on the applet, you can stop and
restart its motion.  (To &quot;shift-click&quot; means to hold down
the shift key while you click the mouse button.)  If you are using
a slow computer, you might want to turn off the Moir&eacute; applet,
so that it doesn't take computer processing time away from other
things going on on this page.</p>

<p>Each of the labs for <cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite> uses an
applet to help you learn something about computer science.  In order
to make it more convenient to use the applets and read the labs at the same
time, the applets are set up to run in separate windows.  The lab worksheet
contains a button that you can click to launch the applet.  In most of the
labs, this button is close to the beginning of the lab, where it will
be easy to find.  (The button is itself a small applet that runs
on the Web page.)</p>

<p>In this lab, you will use a fairly simple applet called &quot;DataReps&quot;.
You will use this applet to learn how the same binary number can be used
to represent different types of data.  To <A NAME="launch">launch</A>
the applet, click on this button:</p>

<p align=center>
<applet codebase="../classes/" archive="DataReps.zip"
        code="tmcm.DataRepsLauncher.class"
        alt="(Java not enabled.)"
        width=150 height=30>
   <font color="#E70000">(Sorry, your browser doesn't do Java!)</font>
</applet>
</p>

<p>The window that opens when you click this button will probably be marked
with some kind of warning, to alert you to the fact that the window was
created by an applet.  For example, on my computer, there is a warning bar
like this one along the bottom of windows opened by applets:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/Intro2.gif" WIDTH="373" HEIGHT="17"></p>

<p>Why the warning?  A Java applet is a program that you have downloaded
from the Internet.  Whenever you download a program, there is a danger that
the program is malicious -- that it will try to damage your computer or
steal information from you.  A great deal of attention has been paid to
making Java applets <font color="#E70000">secure</font>, that is to 
making sure that they can't damage your computer or access private information
stored on your computer.  However, nothing can stop you from entering 
private information, such as a password, into an applet.  The warning on
applet windows is there to stop malicious applets from tricking you into
entering such information.  For example, without the warning, the applet
might imitate a window from a program that has a legitimate need for the
information.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="reps">Data Representations</A></font></H3>

<p>You'll be using the &quot;DataReps&quot; applet,
which you launched <A HREF="#launch">above</A>, in some of the
exercises at the end of the lab.  For now, you should read about
it and experiment with it to see what it does.</p>
<p>This applet lets you type in a data value.  You can select the type of data
you want to enter by clicking on one of the five radio buttons.  Just type
your data into the input box at the top of the applet, and press return.
You can also
click on the 8-by-4 grid of &quot;big pixels&quot; at the center of the applet.
The applet takes the data you enter, and it converts that data into
a 32-bit binary number.  (It has to do this in order to store it!)
It then takes that same binary number and interprets it in six different
ways. The six interpretations are: a binary number, an integer, 
a hexadecimal number, a real
number, a string of four characters, and an eight-by-four grid of
pixels.  You should remember that you see the
same string of thirty-two bits interpreted in different ways. 
You should also remember that the same bit-patterns could also be
interpreted in an endless variety of additional ways: as a
bar of music, or the chemical ingredients in a bar of soap, 
or your tab at your favorite bar, or....)</p>

<p>Here is a short explanation of each of the six data displays.  You should
try entering various types of values in the applet to see how they are
represented as binary numbers.</p>

<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Binary</font>
<DD>This is the most direct display of the
32 bit binary number, showing a zero or one to represent each 
individual bit.  The displayed binary number shows the full 32 bits, 
including any leading zeros.  The computer stores the zeros, even though
you don't ordinarily include leading zeros when you write a number.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Base-ten Integer</font>
<DD> A binary number can be 
interpreted as a normal positive integer (0, 1, 2, 3, 4,...) written in
the &quot;base ten&quot;.  Base ten is the usual way of writing numbers,
using the digits 0 through 9.  See
Section 1.1 of <cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>.
With 32 bits, you can represent 2<sup>32</sup> different numbers.  Usually,
you want to use both positive and negative numbers.  The scheme for representing
negative numbers is a bit strange.  It is explained in Subsection 2.2.3 of
the text.  Using 32 bits, the integers from -2147483648 to 2147483647 can be represented.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Hexadecimal</font>
<DD>It is difficult (for humans) to read
long strings of zeros and ones.  Hexadecimal numbers are a kind of shorthand
for writing such strings.  A hexadecimal number is written using the
sixteen &quot;hexadecimal digits&quot; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Each hexadecimal digit stands for four bits.
So 0 represents 0000, 1 represents 0001, 2 represents 0010, ..., E represents
1110, and F represents 1111.  We could also say that the
hexadecimal digit A stands for the base-ten number 10 (ten), B stands for 11 (eleven),
C stands for 12, D for 13, E for 14, and F for 15.
A hexadecimal number is really just a number written
in the base sixteen, just as ordinary integers are in the base ten
and binary numbers are in the base two.  You should be able to translate
between hexadecimal and binary by hand.  (But of course, you could use
the applet instead.)
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Real Number</font>
<DD>Real numbers are numbers that can contain decimal points, like 3.14159 or
-234.5, or 12.0.  They can also be written using &quot;scientific notation.&quot;
For example, 2.15e12 is a way of writing 2.15 times 10<sup>12</sup>.  The representation
used in computers for real numbers is very complicated.  And it allows some strange
possibilities, such as INF and -INF, which stand for infinity and minus infinity.
There are also NAN's.  NAN stands for &quot;not a number.&quot;  NAN's are used
to represent the results of illegal operations such as taking a square root of
a negative number.  Note that the <b>integer</b> 17 and the <b>real number</b>
17 have completely different representations in the computer, even though 
they are the same number mathematically.
All-in-all, it's probably best not to worry about the
internal representation of real numbers.  I include this data type here for
completeness, since real numbers are so important.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">ASCII Text</font>
<DD>Characters can be encoded using ASCII code, as explained in Section 1.1
of the text.  Each possible character is assigned a code that is one byte (that is, 
eight bits) long.  With 32 bits, you can represents 4 characters in ASCII code.
Not every possible byte represents an ordinary, printable character.  The applet
shows other bytes in the form &lt;#n&gt;, where n is the base-ten number corresponding
to the byte.  For example, the byte 00000111, which is equivalent to 7 in base ten,
is shown as &lt;#7&gt;.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><font color="#E70000">Pixels</font>
<DD>At the center of the applet, you will see an 8-by-4 grid of little squares.
Each of these thirty-two squares corresponds to one bit in the binary number.
You should think of these squares as being very big pixels.  Each pixel can
be either black or white.  One bit specifies the color of one pixel -- 0 for
white or 1 for black.  This is how two-color graphical images can be represented
by binary numbers.  Again, see Section 1.1 of the text.  In the applet, you can
change the color of a pixel by clicking on it.
</DL>




<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="exercises">Exercises</A></font></H3>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>
For this exercise, your goal is to use a search engine such as
<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com">Alta Vista</A> or <A HREF="http://www.webcrawler.com">WebCrawler</A>
to find an interesting page on the World Wide Web.  Pick a topic that interests
you.  Think up some terms related to that topic, and search for pages containing
those terms.  Pick out one you find interesting.  Don't settle for some
boring generic page like ESPN Sports or Apple Computer Inc!
Write a short paragraph saying what your topic was
and how you went about doing the search.  Also include the URL for the
page that you find. </p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>
Search the Web to find the poem written by the Greek poet
Sappho about her daughter Cleis.  How did you go about finding the
poem?  Where did you find it?
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>
Starting from one of the links given <A HREF="#links">above</A>,
find the radius, in kilometers, of the planet Jupiter.  How did you go about finding
it?  
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
Guess the URL of the home page of each of the following.
Explain your reasoning.  (Check the Web to see whether you
are right.)
</p>
<UL>
<LI>The IBM corporation
<LI>The FBI, an agency of the US government
<LI>Harvard University
<LI>The SPCA, an animal-rights organization
</UL>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>
Pick out one or two of the following phrases.  Each phrase is a fragment
of a reasonably well-known quotation.
Search the Web for uses of the phrase.  (Use the
Alta Vista <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=aq">advanced search</A>; 
enter the phrase <strong>in quotes</strong> into the text-input box.  This
will <strong>not</strong> work with the regualar Alta Vista search.)
Thy to find the complete phrase and the original source of the
phrase.  Also, try to find a few interesting variations that people
have used on their Web pages.
</p>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;a truth universally acknowledged&quot;
<LI>&quot;yes, Virginia, there is&quot;
<LI>&quot;on the shoulders of giants&quot;
</UL>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
In addition to working on some of the above exercises, you should
spend some time &quot;surfing&quot; the World-Wide Web.
Write a short essay describing your experiences with the Web
and speculating on its possible impact and importance.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>
Use the &quot;DataReps&quot; applet to find the following.
In each case, indicate briefly what you did with the applet
to answer the question.</p>

<LI>What real number has the same binary representation as the four-letter
word &quot;<font color="#E70000">Fred</font>&quot;?
<LI>What binary number represents the base-10 number <font color="#E70000">-3</font>?
</UL>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font>
Enter the following base-10 integers into the &quot;DataReps&quot; applet:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.  Describe the corresponding pixel representation
of these numbers. (The pixel representation is displayed in the center of the applet).
What pattern do you see?  Why does this pattern occur?  What can you say 
about the binary representation of these numbers?
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font>
Enter a four-letter word such as &quot;TIME&quot; into the &quot;DataReps&quot;
applet.  (Select &quot;ASCII Text&quot; as the input type, type the word
into the applets input box, and press return.)  Consider the pixel representation
of the word, which is displayed in the center of the applet.  Play with the
pixels in the third column of pixels from the left.  Turn them on and off by
clicking on them, and observe what happens to each letter in the word.
What happens?  What does this tell you about the ASCII coding of letters?
(What is the meaning of the third bit in that encoding?)
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 10:</b></font>
This final exercise is meant to be a longer essay question.  You should
try to show your understanding of the way data is represented in a computer,
and an appreciation for the fact that meaning depends on context and
convention.</p>

<p>It would be legal to input <font color="#E70000">1000</font> into the Data
Representation Applet as either a binary number, a base-ten integer, a hexadecimal
number, a real number, or as ASCII text.  In each case, the input is represented
differently -- as a different binary number.  How is it possible that five
different binary numbers can all represent &quot;1000&quot;?  What is going
on here?  How can the computer keep all the different meanings straight?</p>
