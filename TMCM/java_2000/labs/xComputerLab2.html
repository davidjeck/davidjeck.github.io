<p><font size="+2">T</font>HE MACHINE LANGUAGE FOR xComputer consists of
thirty-one different instructions.  Each instruction performs a very
simple task.  Nevertheless, very complex programs can be built up from
these instructions.  The <a href="xComputerLab1.html">previous lab</a>
introduced the xComputer applet and the basic xComputer machine language
instructions.  In this lab, you will learn more about programming the
xComputer.  Hopefully, you'll begin to appreciate how complex programs
can be composed from very simple instructions.</p>

<p>Machine language consists of binary numbers, but it would be almost
impossible for people to program if they had to write programs directly
in binary.  Instead, programmers use <font color="#E70000">assembly 
language</font> or <font color="#E70000">high-level language</font>.
The programs they write in these languages are translated by
<font color="#E70000">assemblers</font> and <font color="#E70000">compilers</font>
into machine language.  You'll use a high-level language called
&quot;xTurtle&quot; in later labs.  In this lab and the next, you'll
use assembly language.</p>

<p>Assembly language is closely related to machine language,
but has several features that make it much easier to use.  You've
already seen that assembly language uses meaningful instruction names,
such as <tt>ADD-C</tt>, instead of numerical instruction codes.
In this lab, you'll see how memory locations and data values can
also be referred to by name rather than by number.  Such names are
called <font color="#E70000">labels</font>.  You'll also learn
about a few new machine language instructions, which use
<font color="#E70000">indirect addressing</font>.

<p>The material in this lab is based on Chapter 3 of
<cite><a href="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The Most Complex Machine</a></cite>.
Labels are introduced in the postscript to that chapter.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="labels">Labels and the Assembler</A></font></H3>

<p>The <a href="xComputerLab1.html">previous lab</a> introduced the xComputer applet
and the most basic aspects of xComputer's assembly language.  Here is an example
repeated from that lab.  This program simply counts forever by adding 1 to location
12 over and over in an infinite loop:


<pre>                    LOD-C 1
                    STO 12
                    LOD 12
                    INC
                    STO 12
                    JMP 2
</pre>

<p>The numbers 12 and 2 in this program are addresses of memory locations.
While this short program is not terribly difficult to understand, it can
be extremely tedious and error prone to keep track of the large number of
numerical addresses that would be used by a complex program.  For this reason,
assembly language allows you to give names to memory locations, so that
you can refer to the locations with meaningful names rather than meaningless
numbers.  Names used in this way are called <font color="#E70000">labels</font>.</p>

<p>To give a name to a memory location in an assembly language program,
all you have to do is put the name, followed by a colon, before the contents
of the memory location.  For example, the line</p>

<pre>            Loop:   LOD 12
</pre>

<p>in a program would give the name &quot;Loop&quot; to the memory
location that contains the <tt>LOD 12</tt> instruction.  Elsewhere in
the program, you can use the word &quot;Loop&quot; to refer to that location,
instead of using the numerical address.  For example, you could jump to
that location with the command <tt>JMP Loop</tt>.</p>

<p>Memory locations can be use to hold either <b>instructions</b> or <b>data</b>.
Labels are useful in both situations.  If &quot;Num&quot; is the label of
a location that is used to hold data, then it would make sense to use
&quot;Num&quot; in data-manipulation commands such as <tt>LOD Num</tt>,
<tt>STO Num</tt>, and <tt>ADD Num</tt>.  Labels for instructions, on the
other hand, are mostly used in jump commands.</p>

<p><a name="counter">Here</a> is a version of the counting program that uses labels.  The
name &quot;Loop&quot; is used for the instruction that begins the loop,
and &quot;Count&quot; is used for the location that contains the value
of the counter:</p>


<pre>                     LOD-C 1       ; Set Count equal to 1
                     STO Count
             Loop:   LOD Count     ; Add 1 to Count
                     INC
                     STO Count
                     JMP Loop      ; Jump back to start of loop

                     @12
             Count:  data          ; Location to be used for counting
</pre>

<p>This example introduces two other features of xComputer's assembly language:
&quot;<tt>@</tt>&quot; and &quot;data&quot;.  The word &quot;data&quot; is used as
a place-holder for a memory location that is going to be used by the program
to contain a data value.  When the assembler translates the program into 
machine language and loads it into memory, it replaces &quot;data&quot;
with a zero.  (Actually, you could just use a 0 in the program, but &quot;data&quot;
is more descriptive of your intentions.)  The line &quot;<tt>@12</tt>&quot;
is not translated into machine language.  It is a directive to the assembler
telling the computer to store the next item in location 12.  In this case,
it means that the Count will be stored in location 12.  Without the
&quot;<tt>@12</tt>&quot;, it would be stored in location 6, the next
sequential location after the <tt>JMP Loop</tt> instruction.  If there
were additional items after Count, they would be stored in locations 13, 14, and
so on -- until the next &quot;<tt>@</tt>&quot; directive.</p>

<p>This program is one of the sample programs loaded by the 
xComputer applet that you launched <a href="#launch">above</a>.
Select the program &quot;SimpleCounter.txt&quot; from the pop-up
menu at the top of the xComputer window.  Load it into xComputer's
memory by clicking on the &quot;Translate&quot; button.  Once it
is loaded, you can use the &quot;Run,&quot; &quot;Step,&quot; or
&quot;Cycle&quot; button to execute the program.  If you need more
information about using the xComputer applet, please see the
<a href="xComputerLab1.html">previous lab</a>.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="loops">Loops and Decisions</A></font></H3>

<p>Complex programs can be constructed using loops, decisions, and subroutines.
All of these things become easier to use when labels are available.  Subroutines
will be introduced in the <a href="xComputerLab3.html">next lab</a>.  In this
lab, you will work with loops and decisions.</p>

<p>Loops, of course, are implemented with jump commands, when the computer
jumps back to a previous location in the program.  Decisions are implemented
with conditional jump instructions such as <tt>JMZ</tt> and <tt>JMN</tt>.
When the computer executes one of theses instructions, it decides whether
or not to jump, based on the current circumstances.  When the computer
encounters the instruction <tt>JMZ Loc</tt>, it checks the accumulator
register.  If the number in the accumulator is zero, then the computer
jumps to location &quot;Loc.&quot;  Otherwise, the computer simply proceeds
on to the next statement following the JMZ.  The <tt>JMN</tt> instruction is
similar, except that it checks whether the number in the accumulator is
negative.  Another conditional jump instruction, <tt>JMF</tt>, tests the
value in the Flag register.  It is described in one of the exercises at
the end of the lab.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p>There are two sample programs for you to look at that make effective
use of loops and decisions.  Each of these programs is used in one of the
exercises at the end of the lab.</p>

<p>The sample program &quot;ThreeNPlusOne.txt&quot;
computes a &quot;3N+1 sequence.&quot;  (This is a problem that you will see
several times in these labs.)  Given a positive integer N, the
program applies the rule: &quot;If N is even, then replace N by N/2;
if N is odd, then replace it by 3N+1.&quot;  It applies this rule over and
over until the number N becomes equal to 1.  
For example, if the starting value of N is 7, then the program generates
the sequence of values: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, and so on.</p>

<p>Run the &quot;ThreeNPlusOne.txt&quot; program.  To see the numbers as they
are generated, watch memory location number 17, which contains the successive
values of N starting with 7.  You will probably want to bump the speed up
to &quot;Fast.&quot;  You can run the program again with any other 
starting value of N.  Modify the value of N in the assembly language
program, and then reload it into memory with the &quot;Translate&quot;
button.  (You could also change the number in location 17 directly
and then run the program.  If you do this, don't forget to click the
&quot;Set PC=0&quot; button to reset the Program Counter to zero.)</p>

<p>You should also read the program and note how it uses the five
labels, &quot;NextN,&quot; &quot;Odd,&quot;  &quot;Even,&quot;  &quot;Done,&quot; 
and &quot;N.&quot; (The label  &quot;Odd&quot;  is defined but is never
referred to in the program.  It is really just there for human readers.)</p>

<p>Another sample program, &quot;MultiplyByAdding.txt&quot; adds two numbers
by adding one of the numbers to itself over and over.  The program is set
up to multiply 13 by 7.  Read the program and try it out.  Use it to multiply
some other pairs of numbers.</p>

<p>Make sure that you understand these programs and the general ideas
of loops and decisions.  You will need to understand them to complete the
exercises at the end of the lab.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="indirect">Indirect Addressing</A></font></H3>

<p>The next sample program is &quot;ListSum.txt.&quot;
This program illustrates a common type
of processing where the computer processes a sequence of consecutive
locations in memory.  In &quot;ListSum.txt&quot;, the computer adds
up the numbers stored in consecutive locations.  It stops when it
gets to a location that contains a zero.  In the exercises, you will
write two programs based on this one.  Before doing those
exercises, you should read the sample program, run it, and try to
understand how it works.</p>

<p>The &quot;ListSum.txt&quot; program uses <font color="#E70000">indirect
addressing</font> to access numbers in the list.
Indirect addressing is used in several assembly 
language instructions, including <tt>LOD-I</tt>, <tt>STO-I</tt>, <tt>ADD-I</tt>,
and  <tt>SUB-I</tt>.  Recall that <tt>LOD-C XXX</tt> tells the computer to
load the number <tt>XXX</tt> into the accumulator.  <tt>LOD XXX</tt>, on
the other hand, tells the computer to copy the contents of memory location
<tt>XXX</tt> into the accumulator.  This is known as
<font color="#E70000">direct addressing</font>.  In the <tt>LOD-I XXX</tt>
instruction, <tt>XXX</tt> is the address of a memory location, but not
of the memory location containing the data.  Instead, memory location
<tt>XXX</tt> contains another address, and that address specifies the
location whose contents are to be loaded into the accumulator.
For example, if location 17 contains the number 42, then <tt>LOD-I 17</tt>
will load the contents of memory location 42 into the accumulator.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this is confusing, but it turns out to be just what we need
to do list processing.  In fact, in that context, its not all that
confusing after all.  Consider the following program outline:</p>

<pre>                      .
                      .   ; Set up 
                      .
                    
                     LOD ListStart ; Load Loc with the starting location  of the list.
                     STO Loc  
                      
          Loop:      LOD-I Loc
          
                      .
                      .   ; Process the number.
                      .
                    
                     LOD Loc       ; Add 1 to Loc.
                     INC
                     STO Loc
                     
                     JMP Loop      ; Return to the start of the loop.
                   
          Loc:       data          ; Location of next number to be processed.
          
          ListStart: 183           ; List of data to be processed.
                     72
                     902
                     164
                      .
                      .
                      .
</pre>

<p>The first time <tt>LOD-I Loc</tt> is executed, it loads 183, the
first number in the list, into the accumulator, since the value of
Loc is ListStart.  After processing the 183, the program adds 1 to
the number in Loc and jumps back to the start of the loop.  The value
stored in Loc is now the address of the second number in the list, 72.
So now when <tt>LOD-I Loc</tt> is executed, it loads 72 into the accumulator.
The next time through the loop, it will load 902, then 164, and so
on.  So, each time through the loop a different location is processed,
even though the instructions in the loop don't change.</p>

<p>&quot;Loc&quot; is said to be a <font color="#E70000">pointer</font> since the
value stored in Loc is not really the number we are interested in.  Instead,
the value in Loc indicates where to go to find the number we want.  It 
&quot;points&quot; to that value.  Pointers
and indirect addressing are used in various ways, even in
high-level languages.  In the next lab, you'll see how useful
indirect addressing can be in a jump instruction.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="dance">Dancing Bits</A></font></H3>

<p>There is another sample program that I've provided mostly for your amusement, but also
because watching it run might just give you a better appreciation of what a
computer is really doing as it computes.  Select the sample program &quot;PowersOfThree.txt,&quot;
from the pop-up menu in the xComputer Window.  Read the comments
at the beginning of the file, and then load the program into xComputer's memory
by clicking on the &quot;Translate&quot; button.  Set the display style
to &quot;Graphics&quot; and the run speed to &quot;Fastest,&quot; and run the program.
You will see the bits in xComputer's memory dance as a non-trivial computation is
performed.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="exercises">Exercises</A></font></H3>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>
The sample program &quot;SimpleCounter.txt&quot; is a copy of the program
that counts forever, which was discussed <a href="#counter">earlier</a> in this lab.
Modify this program so that it counts to 16 and then halts.  (This was also an
exercise in the <a href="xComputerLab1.html">previous lab</a>,
except that in that lab, you didn't use labels.)
Add a HLT statement after the JMP statement.  Use the name &quot;Done&quot;
as a name for that statement.  Jump to Done when the Count reaches 16.


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>
Here is a copy of the &quot;CountAndStore&quot; program that was
used in the previous lab.  (A copy was also loaded as one of the
sample programs by the
xComputer applet on this page.)  Rewrite this program to
use labels, instead of numerical addresses, for locations
2 and 4.  Do you think the program is easier to understand with
labels?
</p>

<pre>
     lod-c 1     ; Start with a 1 in location 12
     sto 12

     lod 12      ; This instruction is stored in location 2
     inc
     sto 13      ; This instruction is stored in location 4

     lod 2       ; Add 1 to the number in location 2
     inc
     sto 2

     lod 4       ; Add 1 to the number in location 4
     inc
     sto 4

     jmp 2       ; Go back to the instruction in location 2

</pre>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>
Modify the &quot;ThreeNPlusOne.txt&quot; program so that it counts
the number of steps it takes for N to become equal to 1.  To do
this, add another labeled location at the end of the program.
Call it &quot;Count&quot;.  Change the program so that it starts
by storing a zero in location Count.  Each time through the loop,
it should add 1 to Count.  When the program ends, the value
in Count is the number of times the program has gone through
the loop.  This is also the number of steps that were computed
in the sequence.  How many steps are there in the sequence
that begins with N=7?  How about N=27?  Be sure to add comments
to your program to explain how Count is being used.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
The assembly language instruction <tt>SHR</tt> shifts the number in
the Accumulator one bit to the right.  That is, each bit in the
binary number is moved over one bit-position to the right.  The leftmost
bit-position, which would be left empty, is filled in with a zero.
The rightmost bit, which has no other place to go, is placed into
the Flag register.  A <tt>JMF</tt> instruction can be used to test
the contents of the Flag register.  Suppose <tt>XXX</tt> is a label.
If the Flag register contains a one, then <tt>JMF XXX</tt> causes
a jump to location <tt>XXX</tt>.  If the Flag register
contains a zero, then <tt>JMF XXX</tt> has no effect.</p>

<p>Write a program that counts the number of 1's in a binary number.
When the program begins, the number should be stored in a memory
location labeled <tt>Num</tt>.  There should also be a memory
location named <tt>Count</tt> for counting the number of 1's in
<tt>Num</tt>.  The program begins by storing a zero in <tt>Count</tt>.
It then goes into a loop that shifts <tt>Num</tt> one bit to the
right.  If the number that &quot;falls off the end&quot; into the
Flag register is a 1, then the program should add 1 to <tt>Count</tt>.
The loop continues until the value of <tt>Num</tt> becomes zero.
At that point, <tt>Count</tt> contains the number of 1's that were
in the original number.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>
Just as it is possible to multiply by adding over and over,
it is possible to divide by subtracting over and over.  Suppose you want to know
how many times N1 goes into N2.  Start with N2 and subtract N1 repeatedly until the
answer is less than N1.  The number of subtractions you performed is the number of
times that N1 goes into N2.  For example, you can compute that 4 goes into 14
three times by computing  14 - 4 - 4 - 4 = 2 .  (The number 2 that you end up with here is
the remainder when 14 is divided by 4.)</p>

<p>Write a program to compute how many times a number N1 goes into another number N2.
Your program will be somewhat similar to the sample program &quot;MultiplyByAdding.txt.&quot;
You still need a loop, and you still need to count how many times
that loop is executed.  However, the set-up before the loop, the action
performed in the loop, and the test for ending the loop are different.
Note that to test whether A &lt; B, you can subtract B from A and
test whether the result is negative.  In the language of xComputer,
you can use a <tt>JMN</tt> instruction to test whether a number is negative.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
The sample program &quot;ListSum.txt&quot; adds up a list
of numbers.  Modify this program so that instead of
computing the sum of the numbers in the list, it will
find the largest number in the list.  Change the
name of the memory location &quot;Sum&quot; to
&quot;Max&quot;.  As the program runs, this memory
location will hold the largest number seen so far
in the list.  When the program ends and the whole
list has been examined, Max will hold the largest
number in the entire list.  (You can compare two
numbers by subtracting one from the other, and
using a <tt>JMN</tt> instruction to test whether
the answer is negative.)
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>
Write another list-processing program that makes
a copy of a list.  You can model your program
on &quot;ListSum.txt.&quot;  However, instead of
adding up the numbers in the list, it should
copy them to another part of memory.  Use
a label named &quot;Copy&quot; to indicate the
location in memory where the copy of the
list should begin.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font>
The &quot;CountAndStore&quot; program in Exercise 1 is
a self-modifying program.  That is, the machine
language instructions in locations 2 and 4 change
as the program is executed.  Another way to write
the program would be to use indirect addressing.
Use a memory location labeled &quot;Loc&quot; to keep
track of which location the program is currently working
on.  Use <tt>LOD-I Loc</tt> and <tt>STO-I Loc</tt> to
load and store values in that memory location.
To move on to the next consecutive memory location,
add one to <tt>Loc</tt>.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font>
Write an essay explaining in detail how indirect addressing
is used in the program you wrote for one of the exercises
above (Exercise 5, Exercise 6, or Exercise 7).
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 10:</b></font>
Write an essay explaining how labels are used in
assembly language programming and why they are so
important.  Give examples of things that can
be done with labels that would be much harder to do without them.
