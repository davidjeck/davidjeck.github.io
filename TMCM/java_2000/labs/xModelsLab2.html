         Adding the Third Dimension</font></H2>

<hr alignt=center width="50%">

<p><font size="+2">R</font>EAL OBJECTS EXIST in three dimensions, and
realistic computer graphics must be able to deal with three-dimensional
objects.  In the <A HREF="xModelsLab1.html">previous lab</A>, you
used the xModels applet to create two-dimensional scenes and
animations.  However, the applet can also use three-dimensional
objects and three-dimensional geometric transformations.  In this
lab, you will add the third dimension to your work with xModels.
</p>

<p>Before starting this lab, you should make sure that you are
familiar with using the xModels applet to write programs and
to view scenes.  You should understand the basics of
the scene description language, including the use of the
<font color="#007000">define</font> command to create new 
objects.  This material was covered in the previous lab and
is not repeated here.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="zaxis">In the Direction of Z</A></font></H3>

<p>Geometric models can be constructed in three dimensions, as well as in two.
Even for three-dimensional models, of course, the image still has to be displayed
on a two-dimensional computer screen, but the
model of the scene exists, at least in our imagination and the computer's
memory, in three dimensions.  Once you understand the basic ideas of geometric
modeling in two dimensions, the step up to three dimensions is not so hard.
Just remember that in addition to the x and y-coordinates that you are
used to, there is also a z-coordinate.</p>

<p>Think of z as measuring distance
in front of the computer screen (or, if z is negative, behind it).
The x-axis is a horizontal line on the computer screen.  The y-axis
is a vertical line on the screen.  The x- and y-axes intersect at
a point called the origin, which is at the center of xModels' display
area.  The z-axis is a line perpendicular to the screen.  Like the
other two axes, the z-axis goes through the origin.  The positive direction
of the z-axis points at you out of the screen.  Larger positive values
are closer to you.  Points behind the screen have negative z-values.
Any point in three dimensions has three coordinates, giving its
position with respect to the x, y, and z axes.</p>

<p>In the <A HREF="xModelsLab1.html">previous lab</A>, you worked with 
two-dimensional objects that lay entirely in the xy-plane.  In this lab, we
add a z-coordinate, and you can work with objects that lie anywhere in
xyz-space.  The image that you see on the screen is obtained by
<font color="#E70000">projecting</font> the three-dimensional objects
onto the two dimensional computer screen.  By default, objects appear
as they would from the point (0,0,20), which is on the z-axis 20 units
in front of the screen.  (Any objects or parts of objects that are
<b>behind</b> this point are not shown at all.)  The number 20 is
called the <font color="#E70000">viewing distance</font>.  You can
set a different viewing distance for a scene by using the
<font color="#007000">viewDistance</font> command in your
scene description.  For example, the command</p>

<p align=center>viewDistance 50</p>

<p>sets the viewing distance to 50.  This means that the objects
are projected onto the xy-plane from the point (0,0,50).  The 
<font color="#007000">viewDistance</font> can only occur once in 
a scene description, and it will have the same effect no matter where
it occurs.</p>

<p>(This description of viewing distance is somewhat misleading,
since xModels will display the same region of the xy-plane, no
matter what the viewing distance.  You might expect to see a larger
region of the xy-plane if you &quot;back up,&quot; but this doesn't
happen.  Things will, however, look more squashed in the z-direction.
Objects that actually lie in the xy-plane will look exactly
the same no matter how the viewing distance is set.)</p>

<p>The xModels applet, which you launched <A HREF="#launch">above</A>,
is set up to load several sample programs.  When it first starts up,
it should be displaying a program called &quot;Flaps.&quot;
Click on the &quot;RENDER!&quot; button to see what this animation
looks like.  The object in the animation is made from eight rectangles,
but the rectangles have been rotated out of the xy-plane so that the
object as whole is three-dimensional.  To understand the scene
description, you'll have to read the next section of the lab.
However, you might want to try adding a <font color="#007000">viewDistance</font>
command to the scene description.  Try several different distance
settings.  In particular, you should try <font color="#007000">viewDistance
5</font>, which places the viewing point <b>inside</b> the object.
Try to understand what you see.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="three">Three-Dimensional Objects and Transformations</A></font></H3>


<p>The basic building blocs of three-dimensional models in the
xModels applet
still include <font color="#007000">line</font>,
<font color="#007000">circle</font>, <font color="#007000">square</font>
and <font color="#007000">polygon</font>,
which start out as two-dimensional objects in the xy-plane but
which can be translated or rotated out of that plane. (You saw an example of
this in the &quot;Flaps&quot; program above.)</p>

<p>There are also a few three-dimensional basic objects in xModels:
A <font color="#007000">cube</font> is a one-by-one-by-one unit cube,
centered at the point (0,0,0).  A <font color="#007000">cone</font> 
is a cone that just fits inside the unit cube, and a 
<font color="#007000">cylinder</font> is a similarly-sized cylinder.
These objects are pretty small, but they can of course be scaled.
For example, if you want to see what a cone looks like, try a scene
description that contains the command:</p>

<p align=center>cone scale 10</p>

<p>There is also a <font color="#007000">polygon_3D</font> command,
which constructs a polygon from a list of three-dimensional points 
instead of two-dimensional points.  Later in the lab, you'll see
two other commands, <font color="#007000">lathe</font> and
<font color="#007000">extrude</font>, which can produce interesting
objects.</p>

<hr width="50%" align=center>

<p>Just as in two-dimensions, the geometric transformations in three
dimensions include scaling, translation, and rotation.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">scale</font> command can be used with
one, two, or three parameters.  With one parameter, as in 
<font color="#007000">scale&nbsp;5</font>, it magnifies an object
equally in all three directions.  If three parameters are given,
they specify different scaling factors in each direction.  For
example,</p>

<pre>                       cube scale 5 0.5 2
</pre>

<p>makes a rectangular solid that is 5 units long in the x-direction,
0.5 units high in the y-direction, and 2 units thick in the z-direction.
If a <font color="#007000">scale</font> has only two parameters,
then the same scaling factor is used in the z-direction as in the
y-direction. (This version is provided mostly for use in two dimensions,
where any scaling in the z-direction has no effect in any case.)</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">translate</font> command can also be used
with one, two, or three parameters.  In its most general form, with
all three parameters, it specifies motion in all three directions.  With
one parameter, it specifies movement in the x-direction only, and with
two parameters, it specifies movement in the x-direction and y-direction
only.  There is a command <font color="#007000">ztranslate</font>
for moving an object in the z-direction only.  For example,
&quot;<font color="#007000">square ztranslate 5</font>&quot; represents
a square that has been moved 5 units forward out of the screen.
(You already saw the analogous commands <font color="#007000">xtranslate</font>
and <font color="#007000">ytranslate</font> in the previous lab.)</p>

<p>Scaling and translation are pretty much the same in three dimensions
as in two, but rotation in three dimensions is another matter.  In two
dimensions, an object is rotated about a point.  A three-dimensional
object must be rotated about a <b>line</b>, like a top spinning about
its axis.  In xModels, there are three rotations commands, for rotation about
the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis, respectively.  The commands are called
<font color="#007000">xrotate</font>, <font color="#007000">yrotate</font>,
and <font color="#007000">zrotate</font>.  (The
<font color="#007000">zrotate</font> command is actually the same
as the plain old <font color="#007000">rotate</font>.)</p>


<p>It is easiest to understand rotation in three dimensions by looking
at examples.  Enter the following simple scene description into
a new program in xModels, and render it:</p>

<pre>                    animate 60
                    square scale 10 yrotate 0:360
</pre>

<p>You will see a square rotating about its vertical axis.  Note that the
edge of the square that is farther from you looks shorter, as it should.
Try the same scene with the square changed to a cube.  Try using
<font color="#007000">xrotate</font> and <font color="#007000">zrotate</font>
instead of <font color="#007000">yrotate</font>.

<p>Next, try the following example, which illustrates a translation in
the z direction followed by a rotation:

<pre>                     animate 60
                     square scale 5 ztranslate 8 yrotate 0:360
</pre>

<p>The <font color="#007000">ztranslate</font>
command moves the square 8 units forward towards
you.  The <font color="#007000">yrotate</font> command then sends
it circling away from you and back.  Try using <font color="#007000">xtranslate</font>
instead of <font color="#007000">ztranslate</font>.  Try
<font color="#007000">xrotate</font> and <font color="#007000">zrotate</font>
in place of <font color="#007000">yrotate</font>.  Make sure that you 
understand what you are seeing.</p>

<hr width="50%" align=center>

<p>Of course, a lot of the power of xModels comes from its ability to
construct complex, hierarchical models using the <font color="#007000">define</font>
command.  You can use <font color="#007000">define</font> to define three
dimensional objects, just as you used it in two dimensions.  You'll work
with some defined objects in the exercises at the end of the lab.</p>

<p>The example program &quot;NestedSquares3D&quot; uses several levels of
object definitions to create what might be the ultimate &quot;nested squares&quot;
example.  Each square rotates on its own, but it also takes part in the
rotation of all the squares in which it is nested.  I find the result
visually interesting, kind of like a mobile.</p>


<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="lathe">Lathing and Extrusion</A></font></H3>

<p>Modeling real objects (like cars or faces) in 3D requires
that they be approximated with large numbers of polygons,
perhaps hundreds of polygons in one object.  You won't want
to do anything so complicated with xModels.  But xModels
does have two ways of producing certain types of complicated objects.
The methods are called <font color="#E70000">lathing</font>
and <font color="#E70000">extrusion</font>.  These are standard
operations in three-dimensional
graphics.  The idea is similar in each case:  a specified figure is
copied several times, and the vertices of the copies are connected with
line segments.  For lathing, the copies are obtained by rotating the
original around the y-axis.  For extrusion, the copies are obtained by
translating the original in the z-direction.  In xModels, the commands
for performing lathing and extrusion are <font color="#007000">lathe</font>
and <font color="#007000">extrude</font>.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">lathe</font> command takes a sequence of
points in the xy-plane and connects them with line segments.  It then
takes the resulting figure and makes several copies of it
by rotating it around the y-axis.  The first parameter of the
<font color="#007000">lathe</font> command indicates the number of copies.
This is followed by a list of the x and y coordinates of the points
in the xy-plane.  This is easier to understand if you see an example.
The command &quot;<font color="#007000">lathe&nbsp;12&nbsp;3,3&nbsp;7,-3</font>&quot;
says that the line from the point (3,3) to the
point (7,-3) is to be copied 12 times.  The copies are evenly spread out 
around the y-axis.  With 12 copies, they are spaced every 30 degrees.
The endpoints of the 12 lines are then connected,
giving an object that looks like a lampshade.  To see it,
type in the following scene description:</p>

<pre>                 animate 60
                 lathe  12  3,3  7,-3
                           yrotate 0:360
</pre>

<p>If you change the 12 to a 4, only 4 copies of the line will be made.  The
resulting object looks like a truncated pyramid.  You could also try
adding another point or two to the end of the lathe command.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">extrude</font> command is similar
to <font color="#007000">lathe</font>.  It also takes a sequence of points
in the xy-plane, connects them with line segments, copies the resulting
figure a specified number of times, and then joins the vertices of the
copies with more line segments.  However in this case, the copies are
translated in the z direction rather than rotated around the y-axis.
The copies are stacked up in front of and behind the screen.  Each copy is
separated from the next by a distance of one unit.  The
simple example &quot;<font color="#007000">extrude&nbsp;10&nbsp;-1,0&nbsp;1,0</font>&quot;
will create a ladder-like object with 10 rungs.  (It will lie along the z-axis,
so if you want to see it, you should apply an <font color="#007000">xrotate 90</font>
to it.)</p>


<p>The sample program &quot;LatheAndExtrude&quot; contains several examples
of lathing and extrusion.  You should read the scene description and render it.</p>

<HR>
<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="exercises">Exercises</A></font></H3>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 1:</b></font> Make an animation showing
three cubes of different colors nested inside one another.  One cube should
rotate about the x-axis, one about the y-axis, and one about the z-axis.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 2:</b></font> The &quot;Flaps&quot;
example program shows an abstract sort of paddle wheel that rotates
about the y-axis.  Paddle wheels are supposed to rotate vertically.
Modify the &quot;Flaps&quot; example so that the &quot;wheel&quot;
is vertical and rotates about the x-axis.  This is a small modification,
if you do it right!  You don't have to modify the definitions of the
&quot;flap&quot; or the &quot;paddles&quot; object.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 3:</b></font> Define an object
that consists of a large cube, ten units on a side, with a circle
on each of its six faces.  Each circle should be a different color.
You will have to work to get all the circles properly oriented and positioned.
You'll need some commands along the lines of &quot;<font color="#007000">circle
scale 8 xrotate 90 ytranslate 5</font>&quot;.  Make an animation that
shows the entire object rotating as a whole.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 4:</b></font> Consider the following four
animations.  (The command &quot;<font color="#007000">viewDistance
infinity</font>&quot; indicates projection from a very large, effectively
infinite distance.  This is also called <font color="#E70000">parallel
projection</font>.)</p>
<pre>            (1)   animate 60
                  viewDistance 20  ;  Note: This is the default value.
                  cube scale 10 yrotate 0:360
                  
            (2)   animate 60
                  viewDistance 100
                  cube scale 10 yrotate 0:360
                  
            (3)   animate 60
                  viewDistance infinity
                  cube scale 10 yrotate 0:360
                  
            (4)   animate 60
                  viewDistance 5
                  cube scale 10 yrotate 0:360
</pre>

<p>Explain what is happening in each animation, and why each animation
looks the way it does.  Explain the differences among them.</p>                 
            


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>  Use lathing to create a
&quot;goblet&quot; shape, like this one:</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xModels5.gif" ALT="Goblet" WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="183"></p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>  The sample program
&quot;Wagon,&quot; which was also used in the previous lab, shows
a simple two-dimensional wagon.  Convert it into a three dimensional
wagon.  Use four wheels.  Use a cube instead of a square as the starting
point for the body of the wagon.  Try out your wagon in an animation
with the command</p>

<pre>                wagon xtranslate -10:10 yrotate 60 xrotate 15
</pre>

<p>You should see a wagon that looks like it's driving away from you
up a hill.</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 7:</b></font>  The picture below shows
a &quot;radio telescope&quot; from several different viewpoints.
This telescope is made of two pieces.
The base is a cone.  You can use a <font color="#007000">cone</font> object, or
you can make it by lathing a single line segment.  The dish of the telescope
is not a cone, since it's cross section is curved.  You can make the dish by
lathing a curve consisting of several line segments connecting
(0,0) to (4,2).  The dish has to be rotated and translated into position
after it is created.  Define a telescope object as described.  Then
make an animation that shows three telescopes rotating back
as forth (sweeping the skies for signs of new galaxies or extraterrestrial
life).</p>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/xModels4.gif" ALT="Telescope"
                                         WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="230"></p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 8:</b></font> Use the xModels applet
to make a three-dimensional image (not an animation) of your choice.
Your scene description should include at least one object definition.
You might, for example, try to make a house, a sailboat, a robot,
or a space station.
</p>


<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 9:</b></font> Use the xModels applet
to make an animation of your choice.  Try to be creative and/or aesthetic.
</p>

<p><font color=blue><b>Exercise 10:</b></font> Write an essay discussing
the differences that you have observed between two-dimensional and
three-dimensional graphics.  Why is three-D graphics harder?  What additional
skills do you need in order to work in three dimensions?  Is it worth the
extra effort?</p>
