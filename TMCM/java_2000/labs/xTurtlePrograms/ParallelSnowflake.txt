  This program illustrates the power of multitasking 
  by using repeated "fork" commands to draw a
  complicated, symmetrical picture.  After the last
  fork command, there are a total of 216 turtles.

  Try running this two ways:  with the "Lock
  Step" checkbox turned on and with it turned off.

fork(6)                 { Draw 6 lines radiating out }
face(60*forkNumber)     { from a common center, spaced }
forward(6)              { every 60 degrees. }

fork(6)                 { At the end of each of those }
face(60*forkNumber+30)  { 6 lines, draw six more lines }
forward(2)

fork(6)                 { And finally, at the end of each }
face(60*forkNumber)     { of the 36 lines already drawn, }
forward(1)              { draw another 6 lines. }
