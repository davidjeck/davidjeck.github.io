{ This program draws a circle of radius 5 with
  little circles of radius 1/2 spaced evenly along
  it.  The big circle is drawn as a sequence
  of eighteen 20-degree arcs.  One little circle
  is drawn at the end of each arc. }


PenUp 
MoveTo(0,-5)
PenDown     { These three commands move the
              turtle to the point (0,-5),
              without drawing a line.  The
              PenDown command is necessary to
              make the turtle start drawing 
              again.  I do this to center the
              picture in the drawing window. }

LOOP  { Means that the following statements,
        up to the END LOOP, are to be 
        repeated. }

   arc(5,20)   { Draws a 20 degree arc along a 
                 circle of radius 5. }

   circle(-0.5)  { A circle of raduis 1/2; the minus
                   sign means that the cicle will be
                   drawn to the RIGHT of the turtle. }
                   
   EXIT IF heading = 0   { Terminates the loop when
                   the turtle is back in its original
                   orientation, facing to the right. }

END LOOP { Marks the end of the sequence of
           statements that make up the loop. }
