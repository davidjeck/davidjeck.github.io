{ This program illustrates input/output in
  xTurtle. (Note, by the way, how the position
  of the turtle changes after the DrawText
  command is executed.) }

{ The program gets an initial bank account
  balance from the user.  It then calculates
  the amount that will be in the account for
  the next five years, assuming that the
  account earns 5% in interest each year. The
  final amount is displayed to the user and
  the amount for each of the five years is
  displayed in the drawing area. }



DECLARE amount { A variable to store the amount
                 of money in the account; this value
                 of this variable changes every year. }

  { First, get the initial deposit from the user.
    (Note that the string in this command has to
    be typed entirely on one line, according to
    the syntax rules of xTurtle. }

TellUser("This program will calculate your bank balance for the next 5 years, assuming a 5% interest rate.")

AskUser("What is starting balance in your account?", amount)

  { Next, move the turtle to the point in
    the drawing area where the amount is
    to appear. }

  { Compute and display the amount after each of
    the next five years.  Each year, 5% interest
    is added to the amount.  This is the same 
    as multiplying the amount by 1.05.  The
    outputs from the DrawText command appear 
    in the drawing area. }

amount := amount * 1.05
DrawText("After one year, you will have $#amount.")

DrawText("After three years, you will have $#amount.")

amount := amount * 1.05
DrawText("After four years, you will have $#amount.")

  { Finally, inform user of the final
    amount in a "TellUser" box. }
