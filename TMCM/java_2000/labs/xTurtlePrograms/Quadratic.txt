{ This program computes the solutions of
  the equation   A*x^2 + B*x + C = 0,
  where A, B, and C are numbers input by
  the user.  The familiar quadratic
  formula is used to find the solutions. }


DECLARE A,B,C  { Constants in the equation. }

DECLARE discriminant  { B^2 - 4*A*C }

DECLARE root1, root2  { the two solutions }
