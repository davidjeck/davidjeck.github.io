; This is a simple counter program that counts 
; 1, 2, 3, and so on.  The counter is stored in 
; location 12.

; This program illustrates the use of labels.
; Note that instructions are indented and
; labels are declared in the margin.  This is
; not a requirement, but it is a common way
; to format assembly language programs.


        LOD-C 1       ; Set Count equal to 1
