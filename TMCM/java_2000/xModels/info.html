<p>Computer-generated graphics images are usually constructed in
two stages: <font color="#E70000">modeling</font> followed
by <font color="#E70000">rendering</font>.  In the modeling stage,
a geometric representation of the objects in the scene is constructed.
The rendering stage produces the actual images, based on information
in the model.</p>

<p>The <A HREF="index.html">xModels Applet</A> lets you describe
scenes in a simple <font color="#E70000">scene description language</font>.
Scenes are rendered as <font color="#E70000">wireframe models</font>,
a very minimal kind of rendering which shows just the edges of all the
objects in the scene -- even edges that are behind other objects.
The main point of the applet is not to produce fancy images; the point
is to learn some of the basic ideas of geometric modeling.</p>

<p>This file contains fairly complete information about the xModels Applet
and about the scene description language that it uses.  Also
available on a separate page are some <A HREF="tutorial.html">tutorial&nbsp;examples</A>.</p>

<p>I invented xModels to use as an example in
<cite><A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM.html">The Most Complex Machine</A></cite>,
a book that surveys the field of computer science. The xModels applet is based on
two similar programs that I wrote for
Macintosh computers (one for two-dimensional and one for three-dimensional
graphics).  These programs are among several that I wrote for
use with <cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>.  All the Macintosh programs
are available for <A HREF="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM/DownloadingInfo.html">downloading</A>.
I am in the process of porting all the Macintosh programs to Java.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000">The xModels Applet</font></h3>

<p>The <A HREF="index.html">xModels applet</A> is designed to be easy to use,
so the major thing you 
need to learn about is the <A HREF="#language">scene description language</A>, which
is discussed below.</p>

<p>The applet has two modes.  In its program mode, it displays a text area
where you can type and edit scene descriptions.  There is a row of
control buttons along the bottom that can be used to render the scene,
to load a program from a file, to save the current program in a file,
and to clear out all the text from the text area.  The applet is in this
mode when it first starts up.  You can only switch to graphics mode
by rendering a legal program.</p>

<p>If you click the &quot;Render&quot; button, the computer will
examine the program contained in the text area to see whether it
is a legal scene description.  If the computer finds an error,
it will report it in a box at the top of the text area.  (You can
make this box go away by clicking on it, if you like.)  If there
are no errors, the applet will switch to graphics mode and the
scene will be displayed.</p>


<p>The second mode is a graphics mode in which the applet displays the
rendered scene.  In this mode, there is a column of controls along the
right edge of the applet.  This column contains:</p>

<UL>
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Frame number label</font> -- shows the currently
displayed frame number during an animation.  (If you find this distracting, 
click on it.)
<LI><font color ="#E70000">New Program button</font> -- takes you back
to program mode, with a new blank text area.
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Show Program button</font> -- takes you back
to program mode, to the program that produced the current scene.
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Go button </font> -- used to restart an
animation that has been paused.
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Pause button</font> -- stops an animation,
and makes the Go, Next Frame, and Previous Frame buttons available.
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Next Frame button</font> -- goes to the
next frame of a paused animation.  When the last frame is reached,
it goes back to frame zero.
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Previous Frame button</font> -- goes to
the previous frame an animation.  When frame zero is reached, it
goes to the final frame.
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Speed pop-up menu</font> -- selects
the desired speed for animation, ranging from one frame per second
to 30 frames per second.  However, note that the actual rate can
be less than the selected rate, depending on the complexity of
the scene and on your computer's speed.
<LI><font color ="#E70000">Looping pop-up menu</font> -- Specifies what
happens in an animation when the last frame is reached.  If this menu
is set to &quot;Loop,&quot; the animation is repeated starting back
at frame zero.  If it is set to &quot;Back-And-Forth,&quot; the
animation is played backwards, then forwards again, and so on.
If it is set to &quot;Once Through,&quot; the animation is paused
when it reaches the final frame.
</UL>

<p>At the very top of the applet, there is another pop-up menu.
This menu is available in both programming mode and graphics mode,
and you can use it to switch between modes and among all the programs
that the applet knows about.  The first item in this pop-up menu
is &quot;Graphics&quot;.  When the applet is in programming mode,
selecting &quot;Graphics&quot; from the pop-up menu is exactly 
the same as clicking on the &quot;RENDER&quot; button.  That is,
the applet will check the current program for errors and, if no
errors are found, will switch to graphics mode and display the
rendered scene.</p>

<p>The second item in the pop-up menu is &quot;[New]&quot;.  Choosing
this item will let you write a new program, starting with an
empty text area.  (This is the same as clicking the New button while
in graphics mode.)  The new program will have the name
&quot;Untitled&nbsp;1&quot; or &quot;Untitled&nbsp;2&quot; or....</p>

<p>The remaining items in the menu are names of programs.  Selecting
one of these names will take you directly to that program.  If you
do this while the program is in graphics mode, it will switch back
to programming mode.</p>

<H3><font color="#E70000"><A NAME="language">The Scene Description Language</A></font></h3>

<p>Scenes in xModels are described in terms of three coordinates, x, y, and z.
The computer's screen is the xy-plane, with the origin (0,0) at the center
of the graphics display area.  The positive y-axis extends upwards from this point,
and the positive x-axis points to the right.  The z-axis points directly out
from the screen towards the viewer, so that points in front of the screen have
positive z-values, and points behind the screen have negative z-values.  This is
a standard coordinate system for three-dimensional computer graphics.</p>

<p>The graphics display area includes the square region with -10&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;10
and -10&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;y&nbsp;&lt;10.  Since the display area might not be square,
it can actually extend beyond this range in one direction.  There is no
way to increase or decrease the basic square region that is displayed, so scenes
must be sized to fit into this region.  (It is easy to scale objects up or down
in size to fit.)</p>

<p>The three-dimensional world is projected onto the xy-plane from a point
on the positive z-axis.  The z-coordinate of this point is called the
<font color="#E70000">viewDistance</font>, and its value can be specified as part of
a scene description.  (This name is somewhat deceptive.  Since the display
area always shows the same square region, objects on the xy-plane don't
look smaller as the viewDistance increases.  They just look more squashed in
the z-direction.)  The viewDistance can be set to &quot;infinity&quot; to
give what is called a <font color="#E70000">parallel projection</font>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, a scene description for xModels is a list of objects
that appear in the screen, plus a few special commands.  Special
commands are used to specify colors, view distance, and animation parameters.
There are a few basic named objects, such as <font color="#007000">circle</font>
and <font color="#007000">cone</font>.  There is also a command for defining
new named objects.  Geometric transformations such as <font color="#007000">rotate</font>
and <font color="#007000">scale</font> can be applied to objects to specify their
size, position, and orientation.  You can make complex, hierarchical objects
that contain other objects, which can have their own transformations.
Animation is done by letting parameters, such as the scaling factor in a 
<font color="#007000">scale</font> transformation, vary through a range of
values as the animation proceeds from frame to frame.  The rest of this
file gives the details of the scene description language.</p>

<p>I should note that a scene description can contain comments.
A comment begins with a semicolon (;) and continues until the end of
the line.  For multiline comments, a semicolon is required on each line.
A comment doesn't have to start at the beginning of a line.</p>

<p>Except in the case of comments, xModels doesn't pay attention
to ends-of-line.  They are treated just like spaces.  You can lay out
your program any way you like on the page.</p>

<p>The xModels language is not case-sensitive:  Upper and lower case letters
are considered to be equivalent.  Names can consist of letters, digits, and
the underscore character&nbsp;(_).  A name must begin with a letter or with
an underscore.  Names can be of any length.  A word with a predefined meaning,
such as <font color="#007000">square</font> or <font color="#007000">animate</font>,
cannot be reused as the name of a defined object.</p>

<p>Numbers can include decimal points and exponential notation.
For example:  -17, 3.14, .5, 1.2e5.  With just a few exceptions,
anyplace where a number can appear in a program, a <font color="#E70000">number
range</font> can also appear.  Number ranges are used with animation, as 
described later in this file.  Examples of number ranges are 1:10, -1:3:10,
and 12::0.  (The only places where number ranges cannot be substituted for
numbers are in the <font color="#007000">animate</font> command and
for the first parameter of the <font color="#007000">lathe</font>
or <font color="#007000">extrude</font> command.</p>

<p>As a final preliminary point, I will note that commas can be included
in a program to help make it more readable by humans.  However, the computer
ignores commas.  More specifically, it treats them exactly the same as
spaces.</p>

<p><b><font color="#E70000">Special Commands</font></b></p>

<p>The special commands in xModels are <font color="#007000">animate</font>,
<font color="#007000">viewDistance</font>, <font color="#007000">background</font>, 
<font color="#007000">define</font>, and various commands for specifying the
color to be used for drawing.</p>

<p>If the <font color="#007000">animate</font> command occurs at all in a program,
<b>it must be the first word</b> in the program (not counting any comments the might
precede it).  This command, which is used to specify the number of frames
in an animation, is defined below.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">viewDistance</font> command specifies the point
along the z-axis that is used as the center of projection.  An (x,y,z) point
is projected onto the xy-plane by drawing a line from the center of projection
through the point (x,y,z) and finding the (x,y) point where it intersects
the xy-plane.  Objects behind the projection point are not displayed.  The
<font color="#007000">viewDistance</font> command must be followed by
a parameter that specifies the z-coordinate of the projection point.
The parameter can be any positive number.  If the scene is an animation,
the parameter can be a number range.  The parameter can also be the word
<font color="#007000">infinity</font> which specifies projection from
infinity.  A program can contain at most one viewDistance command.
If none is specified, a default value of 20 is used.   The 
<font color="#007000">viewDistance</font> command does not have to
come at the beginning of the program.  However, it applies to the entire scene
in any case.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">background</font> command is used to specified
the background color for the scene.  This command must be followed by
a color specification.  The color can be specified by one of the specific
color words listed below.  It can also be given using the <font color="#007000">rgb</font>
or <font color="#007000">hsb</font> color command.  Since <font color="#007000">rgb</font>
and <font color="#007000">hsb</font> can use number ranges as parameters,
the background color can change from one frame of an animation to the next.
The default background color is white.
The <font color="#007000">background</font> command does not have to appear at the
beginning of the program.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">define</font> is used to give a name to
an object.  Once a named object has been defined, it can be used in the same
way as any of the built-in objects, including in the definitions of other
named objects.  The <font color="#007000">define</font> must be followed
by the name of the object, and then by the specification of the object
itself.  The object is generally a complex object, enclosed between
[ and&nbsp;], but that is not a requirement.  Defining an object does
<b>not</b> make the object appear in the scene.  To do that, you have
to include the object name as part of the scene description.  The following
example defines a &quot;wheel&quot; to consist of a circle and three
lines:</p>

<pre>              define wheel [
                   circle
                   line
                   line rotate 60
                   line rotate -60
                ]
</pre>

<p>A color can be specified by one of the following color names:
<font color="#007000">red</font>, <font color="#007000">green</font>,
<font color="#007000">blue</font>, <font color="#007000">cyan</font>,
<font color="#007000">magenta</font>, <font color="#007000">yellow</font>,
<font color="#007000">black</font>, <font color="#007000">white</font>,
<font color="#007000">gray</font>, <font color="#007000">lightGray</font>,
or <font color="#007000">darkGray</font>.  Color can also be specified
by the <font color="#007000">rgb</font> command or the <font color="#007000">hsb</font>
command.  The <font color="#007000">rgb</font> command lets you specify a color
by giving its red, blue, and green components.  It requires three parameters
to specify the three values.  The values must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.
For example:</p>

<pre>         rgb  1, 0.5, 0.5    ;  specifies a pinkish color
         rgb  0:1 0 0        ;  specifies a range of colors from black to red
</pre>

<p>The <font color="#007000">hsb</font> command is similar, except it specifies
a color by giving its hue, brightness, and saturation components.  Again, these
values must be between 0 and&nbsp;1.  (You can look this up in a graphics
textbook if you don't know what it means.)</p>

<p>When a color command is given, it sets the drawing color to be used
for all subsequent objects, up until the next color change.  Color changes
inside complex objects, that is between [ and ], have no effect past the
closing&nbsp;].  The default drawing color is black.</p>


<p><b><font color="#E70000">Objects</font></b></p>

<p>There are six predefined objects in xModels:
<font color="#007000">line</font>, <font color="#007000">square</font>,
<font color="#007000">circle</font>, <font color="#007000">cube</font>,
<font color="#007000">cone</font>, and <font color="#007000">cylinder</font>.
These objects are sized so that each object just fits inside
a 1-by-1-by-1 cube, centered at the origin.  The <font color="#007000">line</font>
object stretches along the x-axis from (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0).  The
<font color="#007000">square</font> object has vertices at
(-0.5,-0.5), (0.5,-0.5), (0.5,0.5), and (-0.5,0.5).  The <font color="#007000">circle</font> has center
(0,0) and radius 0.5.  The <font color="#007000">cone</font> is oriented to point
upwards along the y-axis.  The <font color="#007000">cylinder</font> also has
a vertical orientation.  To include one of these objects, just list its
name in the scene description.  Usually, the name will be followed by
a transformation that affects the size, position, and orientation of the
object.</p>

<p>There are also four commands for creating an object out of a list of
points.  These commands are <font color="#007000">polygon</font>,
<font color="#007000">polygon_3d</font>, <font color="#007000">lathe</font>,
and <font color="#007000">extrude</font>.  The <font color="#007000">polygon</font>
command takes a list of parameters that specify a sequence of (x,y) points.
The polygon consists of these points joined by lines.  Note that there
must be an even number of parameters, since there are two parameters per
point.  For example, the following command creates a triangle:</p>

<pre>             polygon  0,0 4,0 2,2</pre>

<p>It's legal to have a polygon command with just two points.  In that case,
it specifies a line.  The polygon-3d is similar, except that it takes
a list of (x,y,z) points.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">lathe</font> command takes a list of (x,y) points, joins those points with
line segments, and then rotates the resulting curve about the y-axis to
obtain a three-dimensional object.  The original curve is actually copied
several times, at different angles of rotation.  These copies are then joined
with further line segments.  The number of copies must be specified as
the first parameter to the <font color="#007000">lathe</font> command.  The remaining
parameters specify the (x,y) points.  For example, the following command
makes four rotated copies of the line segment from (0,5) to (3,0) and
then connects them with lines to produce a pyramid:</p>

<pre>             lathe 4  0,5  3,0</pre>

<p>It is legal to have a lathe command with just one point.  The result will be
a regular n-sided polygon lying in the xz-plane.</p>

<p>The <font color="#007000">extrude</font> command is similar to
<font color="#007000">lathe</font> in that it makes several copies of a curve
that lies in the xy-plane, and it then joins those copies with lines.  However, 
<font color="#007000">extrude</font> makes the copies by translating the
original curve along the z-axis.  Each copy is separated from the next
by one unit along the z-axis.  The z-values are centered about 0.
for example, for <font color="#007000">extrude&nbsp;2</font>,
the two z-values are -0.5 and 0.5.</p>

<p>Besides all these basic objects, you can make <font color="#E70000">complex
objects</font>.  A complex object is a list of items enclosed between
a left bracket, [, and a right bracket,&nbsp;].  It can include objects
and color specifications.  Each object in a complex object can be
followed by its own set of transformations, as described below.  The
objects can include basic objects, named objects created with
the <font color="#007000">define</font> command, and nested complex
objects.  Because of this ability to nest complex objects inside other
complex objects, xModels is said to use <font color="#E70000">hierarchical
models</font>.</p>


<p><b><font color="#E70000">Transformations</font></b></p>

<p>Any object can be followed by a list of one or more transformations
that affect the size, position, and orientation of that object.  This 
includes complex objects.  Any transformation applied to a complex object
is applied to that object as a whole.  If an object inside a complex
object has its own transformations, they are applied first, followed
by the overall transformation of the object as a whole.</p>

<p>A transformation consists of a word specifying the type of transformation,
followed by one or more parameters.  For example, the command 
<font color="#007000">rotate&nbsp;30</font> specifies that the object
is to be rotated through an
angle of 30 degrees about the z-axis.  Some transformations take a variable
number of parameters.  For example, <font color="#007000">scale&nbsp;3</font>
will magnify the object by a factor of 3 in all directions, while
<font color="#007000">scale&nbsp;2,6,0.5</font> will scale it by
factors of 2 in the x-direction, 6 in the y-direction, and 0.5 in the
z-direction.</p>

<p>When an object is followed by several transformations, they are applied
in the order given.  For example in,</p>

<pre>           square  xtranslate 5  rotate 30</pre>

<p>the square is first translated 5 units in the positive x-direction, and
is then rotated by 30 degrees about the origin.  Putting the transformations
in the opposite order:</p>

<pre>           square  rotate 30  xtranslate 5</pre>

<p>gives a different result, since the square is first rotated and then
translated.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the transformations used in xModels, where A, B, C,
D, E, F, and G are numbers (or, in the case of an animation, number ranges):</p>

<UL>
<LI><font color="#007000">scale A B C</font> -- Scales by factors of A in the x direction,
B in the y direction, and C in the z direction.  Scaling by a fractional amount makes
an object smaller.  Scaling by a negative amount reflects the object through the
corresponding coordinate plane.  The scaling is centered at the
origin; all other points move away from or towards the origin.  
<LI><font color="#007000">scale A B</font> -- same as &quot;scale A B B&quot;.
<LI><font color="#007000">scale A</font> -- same as &quot;scale A A A&quot;.
<LI><font color="#007000">xscale A</font> -- same as &quot;scale A 1 1&quot;; scales in x-direction only.
<LI><font color="#007000">yscale A</font> -- same as &quot;scale 1 A 1&quot;; scales in y-direction only.
<LI><font color="#007000">zscale A</font> -- same as &quot;scale 1 1 A&quot;; scales in z-direction only.
<LI><font color="#007000">translate A B C</font> -- Moves each point (x,y,z) to
(x+A,y+B,z+C). The effect is to move the object A units in the x-direction, B units
in the y-direction, and C units in the z-direction.
<LI><font color="#007000">translate A B</font> -- same as &quot;translate A B 0&quot;.
<LI><font color="#007000">translate A</font> -- same as &quot;translate A 0 0&quot;.
<LI><font color="#007000">xtranslate A</font> -- same as &quot;translate A 0 0&quot;; moves an object A units in the x-direction.
<LI><font color="#007000">ytranslate A</font> -- same as &quot;translate 0 A 0&quot;; moves an object A units in the y-direction.
<LI><font color="#007000">ztranslate A</font> -- same as &quot;translate 0 0 A&quot;; moves an object A units in the z-direction.
<LI><font color="#007000">xrotate A</font> -- Rotates everything though an angle of A degrees about the
x-axis.  The x-axis is fixed, and everything else pivots around it.  The direction to
use for positive angles is determined by the &quot;right-hand rule&quot;: Point the thumb
of your right hand in the direction of the positive axis, and the fingers of your
right hand will curl in the direction of a positive angle.
<LI><font color="#007000">yrotate A</font> -- Rotates everything though an angle of A degrees about the
y-axis.
<LI><font color="#007000">zrotate A</font> -- Rotates everything though an angle of A degrees about the
z-axis.
<LI><font color="#007000">rotate A</font> -- same as &quot;zrotate A&quot;.  In the xy-plane,
this looks like a rotation about the origin, with positive angles representing counterclockwise
rotation and negative angles, clockwise rotation.
<LI><font color="#007000">rotate A about B C</font> -- Rotate through an angle
of A degrees about the line that starts at the point (B,C,0) and extends in the
same direction as the positive z-axis.  In the xy-plane, this is just rotation 
about the point (B,C).
<LI><font color="#007000">rotate A about line B C D</font> -- Rotate by an
angle of A degrees about the line that goes from the origin, (0,0,0), to the
point (B,C,D).  (The two words &quot;about line&quot; can also be written
as a single word &quot;aboutline&quot;.)  If (B,C,D) = (0,0,0), nothing happens.
<LI><font color="#007000">rotate A about line B C D E F G</font> -- Rotate by an
angle of A degrees about the line that goes from the point (B,C,D) to the
point (E,F,G). 
<LI><font color="#007000">xSkew A</font> -- This is the transformation
which moves (x,y,z) to (x+Ay,y,z).  Lines that were perpendicular to the
xz-plane are tilted (or &quot;skewed&quot;) to the left or right.
<LI><font color="#007000">ySkew A</font> -- This is the transformation
which moves (x,y,z) to (x,y+Ax,z).
<LI><font color="#007000">xyShear A B</font> -- This is the transformation
which moves (x,y,z) to (x+Az,y+Bz,z).  Lines perpendicular to the
xy-plane are skewed.  (I have not included a complete set of skew/shear
transformations, because I don't expect them to be used much.)
</UL>

<p>Note that although xModels is a 3-dimensional graphics program, you can 
restrict yourself to two dimensions if you want.  The names and semantics
of the transformations were chosen so that all the two-dimensional transformations
are available with reasonable names.  This explains the otherwise odd
<font color="#007000">rotate A about&nbsp;B&nbsp;C</font>, for
example.</p>

<p>It is important to understand what a list of transformation does to an 
object.  All the transformations are applied to the object before it is displayed.
So, <font color="#007000">square scale&nbsp;2&nbsp;5</font> is just a way
of specifying a 2-by-5 rectangle, and <font color="#007000">circle translate&nbsp;5</font>
is just a way of specifying a circle centered at the point (5,0).  You don't
actually see the object moving or changing shape.  For that,
you have to use an animation and specify a range of values for
the transformation.   In that case, each frame of the animation gets its own
transformation to specify the shape or position of the object in that frame.
The object can change from one frame to the next, because a different
transformation is used in each frame.</p>

<p><b><font color="#E70000">Animation</font></b></p>

<p>An animation is just a sequence of frames.  Each frame contains a 
separate image.  If the images don't change too much from one frame to the
next, the viewer will perceive continuous motion as the frames are
played back in rapid succession.</p>

<p>In xModels, a scene description that starts with the command
<font color="#007000">animate&nbsp;N</font>, where N is a positive
number, is an animation with N+1 frames.  The frames are numbered from
0 to N.  (You should think of N as the number of intervals between
frames.)  Then, to get any kind of motion or change in the animation, 
you need to make some quantity change from frame to frame.  This is
done by using number range in place of a number.  A number range consists
of a starting value, followed by a colon, followed by a final value.
In each frame of the animation, the number range represents a different
value.  For example, in an 11-frame animation, the number range
0:5 represents 0 in frame 0, 0.5 in frame 1, 1 in frame 2,...
and 5 in frame 11.  Thus, the scene description:</p>

<pre>              animate 10
              circle scale 0:5
</pre>

<p>shows a circle that grows from a size of 0 in the first frame to 
a size of 5 in the last frame.  And</p>

<pre>             animate 30
             square scale 5 rotate 0:90
</pre>

<p>shows a 5-by-5 square pivoting through a 90-degree turn about the origin.
Note that the value 5 in this example is the same in each frame.  You don't
need to use a number range for each value in an animation -- only for the
values that you actually want to change during the animation.</p>

<p>By adding additional parameters to the animate command, you can make
&quot;segmented animations.&quot;.  For example, the command
<font color="#007000">animate&nbsp;30&nbsp;50</font> specifies an
animation with two segments.  The first segment has 31 frames, and the
second segment has 51.  The final frame of the first segment is also the
first frame of the second segment, so there are 81 frames in all.  (Remember
that the numbers 30 and 50 actually specify the intervals between frames.)
An animation can contain any number of segments. The first frame of the
animation, the last frame, and any frame that is on the boundary
between two segments are called <font color="#E70000">key
frames</font>.</p>

<p>A number range used in a segmented animation must specify a value for
each of the key frames.  Thus, it must have exactly as many colons as
there are segments in the animation.  For example, the number range 10:5:7 
could be used in a two-segment animation.  During the first segment, 
the value ranges from 10 to 5, and during the second segment, it ranges
from 5 to 7.  The number range 0:0:10  has the constant value 0 throughout
the first segment, and then its value ranges from 0 to 10 during the
second segment.  Sometimes, you want a quantity that changes at a
constant rate during the whole animation, rather than at different
rates in different segments.  The notation for doing this is to use
two or more colons in a row, with no numbers  between.  For
example, 0::10  represents a quantity that varies evenly from 0 to 10
across both segments of a two-segment animation.</p>
