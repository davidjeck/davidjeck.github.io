<p>The final exam period for this course is Wednesday, December 8, from 7:00 to 9:00 PM.
We will use this period for <a href="f22/final-project.html">final&nbsp;project</a> presentations.</p>


<hr>

<h3>Fifteenth Week: November 29 and 30; December 2</h3>

<p>For the last week of the semester, we will turn again to metric spaces.
After a short review of the material that we looked at previously, I will
cover three new topics:

<hr>

<h3>Fourteenth Week: November 21</h3>

<p>Because of Thanksgiving break, we only have class on Monday this week.  (Happy Thanksgiving!)</p>

<p>We will finish our look at series of functions, which will also finish Chapter 4.  That's the last of
what we will do from the textbook!  We should also take some time to talk about final projects.</p>

<p>Resubmissions for Homework 9 are due on Wednesday, November 30.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Thirteenth Week: November 14, 16, and 18</h3>

<p>The second takehome exam is due at the start of class on Friday, November 18:</p>

<p align=center class=np><a href="f22/takehome2.pdf">Second Take-home Exam</a></p>

<p>The second in-class test will be on Friday, November 18.  Here is the study guide:</p>

<p align=center class=np><a href="f22/test2info.pdf">Second In-class Exam Study Guide</a></p>

<p>Aside from the tests, we will work on Section 4.6, Series of Functions. Here is a
summary of the main results:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/17-series-of-functions.html">17. Series of Functions</a></li>

to Monday, November 14.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Twelfth Week: November 7, 9, and 11</h3>

<p>Here is web page that we looked at in class on Friday: <a href="f22/nov11/index.html">Math 331, November 11</a></p>

<p>We have looked at convergence tests for series of real numbers from Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
We will work on examples of applying those tests.  The we move on to Section 4.5, which
covers sequences of functions.  For a summary of results from Section 4.5, see</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/16-sequences-of-functions.html">16. Sequences of Functions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And see <a href="https://math.hws.edu/~mitchell/FoundationsOfAnalysis/">Professor Mitchell's web site</a>, 
mentioned at the end of that summary, for some interactive examples.</p>

<p>The second take-home test and second in-class are coming up.  The take-home test will be
distributed this Friday, and the in-class test is next Friday.  With a lot coming up in
the next two weeks, here is a schedule:</p>

    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Eleventh Week: October 31; November 2 and 4</h3>

<p>We covered monotone sequences and the Monotone Convergence Theorem from Section 4.2 last Friday.
We will cover Cauchy sequences from that section on Monday, and we will then move on to infinite
series, Sections&nbsp;4.3 and possibly into Section&nbsp;4.4 on Friday.  Here is an outline of
the material on sequences and series of real numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/15-sequences-and-series.html">15. Sequences and Series</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that <a href="f22/hw8.pdf">Homework 8</a> and the revisions for 
<a href="f22/hw8.pdf">Homework&nbsp;7</a> are due on Wednesday.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Tenth Week: October 24, 26, and 28</h3>

<p>We will finish will finish Chapter 3 with a proof of the Second Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus and a look at Taylor polynomials.  And to finish integration, I want to briefly
cover improper integrals, which are covered in the book only in Exercise 3.5.16.  We will 
then move on to Chapter&nbsp;4, which covers sequences and series.  The reading for
the week is sections 3.7, 4.0, and 4.1.  It is possible that we will start Section&nbsp;4.2
on Friday.  Here is a summary of the material on Taylor Polynomials:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/14-taylor-polynomials.html">14. Tarylor Polynomials</a></li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h3>Ninth Week: October 17, 19, and 21</h3>

<p>We continue the study of the Riemann integral with Section 3.5 (properties of the integral)
and Section 3.6 (Fundamental Theorems of Calculus).  Here is a short summary of the results
in those two sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/13-integral-theorems.html">13. Integral Theorems</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that revisions for Homework 5 are due by Wednesday, October 19.  Homework&nbsp;6 is due
this Monday, October&nbsp;17, and Homework&nbsp;7 is due next Monday, October&nbsp;24.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Eighth Week: October 12 and 14</h3>

<p>There is no class on Monday because of Fall break.</p>

<p>This course requires a final project and presentation, which is due at the
end of the semester.  Everyone in the class needs a different topic.  
Here is more information about the project, including some ideas for
possible topics:</p>

<p align=center class=np style="font-size:110%"><a href="f22/final-project.html">About the Final Project</a></p>

<p>We did not get to Section 3.3, which covers the Mean Value Theorem, so we will pick
up there on Wednesday.  However, I will not cover the generalized mean value theorem
and L'Ho&#770;pital's rule from that section; that material will be left as reading, if you want to do it.
We will then move on to Section 3.4, which defines the
Riemann integral.  Here is a summary of the definitions and basic theorems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/12-riemann-integral.html">12. The Definite Integral</a></li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h3>Seventh Week: October 3, 5, and 7</h3>

<p>There is an <a href="f22/test1info.pdf">in-class test</a> on Monday, and the
<a href="f22/takehome1.pdf">take-home test</a> is due at the same time. A&nbsp;short
<a href="f22/hw5.pdf">homework</a> on metric spaces will be due on Friday, along
with revisions for homework&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>For Wednesday and Friday, we move on to Chapter&nbsp;3.  The reading for
the week is Sections 3.1, 3.2, and&nbsp;3.3.  These sections cover the definition
and basic properties of the derivative.  The material will be familiar to you 
from Calculus&nbsp;I.  Here is a short summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/11-derivatives.html">11. Derivatives</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Sixth Week: September 26, 28, and 30</h3>

<p>It's testing time!  A <a href="f22/takehome1.pdf">take-home test</a> is available.  An in-class test is scheduled
for next Monday, October&nbsp;3.  The take-home will be due at the start of the in-class test on Monday, October&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>There is also an in-class test on Monday, October 3.  A <a href="f22/test1info.pdf">study&nbsp;guide</a> is available and
will be handed out in class on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Homework 4 is due on Monday of this week (September 26), along with any revisions for Homework&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>In lecture this week, we will continue with metric spaces.  We still need to cover some material
on <a href="https://math.hws.edu/eck/metric-spaces/open-and-closed-sets.html" style="white-space:pre">Open and Closed Sets</a>.
After that we will move on to <a href="https://math.hws.edu/eck/metric-spaces/limits-and-continuity.html" 
style="white-space:pre">Limits and Continuity</a>.  This will include infinite sequences in metric spaces and their
limits.  For the case of sequences in the real numbers, you can also see Section&nbsp;4.1 in the textbook.
here is a short summary of the main facts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/10-limits-and-continuity-in-metric-spaces.html">10. Limits and Continuity in Metric Spaces.</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Fifth Week: September 19, 21, and 23</h3>

<p>We mostly finished with Section 2.5, continuity, last week.  This week we will cover 
continuity on closed intervals, Section&nbsp;2.6, including two important theorems:
the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Extreme Value Theorem.  That will finish
Chapter&nbsp;2.  After that, we will be taking a short break from the textbook
to look at metric spaces.  A metric space is a set, M, together with a function
d(x,y) for x,y in M that generalizes the notion of distance in the real numbers.
You should read the following on-line material about metric spaces:
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/eck/metric-spaces/">Introduction to metric spaces</a> and
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/eck/metric-spaces/open-and-closed-sets.html">Open and Closed Sets</a>.
Here are reading guides for continuity and for metric spaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/08-continuity.html">08. Continuity and Uniform Continuity</a></li>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/09-metric-spaces.html">09. Metric Spaces</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In class on Friday, September 16, we looked at an example of an increasing function defined on the
interval (0,1) that is continuous at every irrational number and has a jump discontinuity at
every rational number.  The web page</p>

<p align=center><a href="f22/strangegraph.html">strangegraph.html</a></p>

<p>draws a very close approximation of the function.  However, note that almost all of the
jumps are too small to see, so that it really looks like the graph is constant on
most subintervals.  In fact, I can only see nine or ten jumps.  The web page gives you some
options to make a more satisfactory graph.  Now, maybe you'd like to think about what the ranged of these
functions look like.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Fourth Week: September 12, 14, and 16</h3>

<p>We will continue with limits, Sections 2.2 through 2.4.  Section 2.4 briefly covers limits at infinity,
infinite limits, and one-sided limits.  The reading guide for Section 2.4 is here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/07-other-limits.html">07. Other Kinds of Limit</a></li>
</ul>

<p> By the end of the week, we will at least start Section 2.5, on continuity. (I have dropped the
idea of looking at Section 4.1 this week; we will get to infinite sequences after we finish 
Chapter&nbsp;2 and cover some of the basics of metric spaces.)</p>

<p>The due date for Homework 3 has been extended to <b>Monday (September 19), at 3:00</b>.  However,
revisions for Homework&nbs;2 are still due by 3:00 on Thursday (September&nbsp;15).</p>

<hr>

<h3>Third Week: September 5, 7, and 9</h3>

<p>We begin the week with the proof of the Heine-Borel Theorem, the definition of accumulation point,
and the Bolzano Weirstrass Theorem. That will complete Chapter&nbsp;1.  We will move on to Chapter&nbsp;2,
which covers differential calculus.  The main reading is Section&nbsp;2.1, on functions, and
Section&nbsp;2.2, on limits, although I will try to get started on Section&nbsp;2.3 by 
the end of the week.  Most of the
material in Section&nbsp;2.1 should be familiar to you, and we will only look at a few points from
that section in class.  Here is the reading guide for Sections&nbsp;2.2 and&nbsp;2.3:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/06-limits.html">06. Limit of a Function at a Point</a></li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h3>Second Week: August 29 and 31; September 2</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is to finish Section 1.2, read Section 1.3, and start Section 1.4.
After finishing Section 1.2, we will turn to an axiom system for the real numbers.  I hope that
by the end of the week, we will start Section 1.4, up to the proof of the Heine-Borel Theorem.
The reading guides for this material can be found here (but I don't expect to cover the
Bolzano-Weirstrass Theorem until next week):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/04-axioms-for-R.html">04. Axioms for the Real Numbers</a></li>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/05-heine-borel-theorem.html">05. Heine-Borel and Bolzano-Weirstrass Theorems</a></li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h3 >First Week: August 22, 24, and 26</h3>

<p>Welcome to the course!</p>

<p>The reading for the week is Chapter 1, Sections 1.0 through 1.2.  Please read them!  
We will continue with Section&nbsp;1.2 next week.  Note that you are not responsible for
the parts of the reading that cover historical background.
From Section 1.1, you should be familiar with irrational numbers 
and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
(but we will not spend a great deal of time on that theorem, and you are not responsible
for the proof).  Section 1.2 gives
a "construction" of the set of real numbers; that is, it defines a specific mathematical
object that has the properties that we expect the real numbers to have.</p>

<p>I plan to publish short <a href="f22/guide2022/index.html">guides</a> to the readings, emphasizing
the most important points and often adding information or
perspective that is not in the textbook.  Generally, there will only be one or two guides per week,
but for this first week, there are three; the third reading guide will carry us into next week:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/01-irrational-numbers.html">01. Irrational Numbers</a></li>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/02-dedekind-cuts.html">02. Dedekind Cuts</a></li>
<li><a href="f22/guide2022/03-least-upper-bound-axiom.html">03. Least Upper Bound Property</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The reading guides are part of the required reading!</p>


<p>The <a href="f22/hw1.pdf">first homework assignment</a> is already available.  You are encouraged to
write up your solutions in LaTeX, using a free account at <a href="https://overleaf.com">overleaf.com</a>,
but I will also accept neatly handwritten work.  For more information
about submitting homework, see</p>
