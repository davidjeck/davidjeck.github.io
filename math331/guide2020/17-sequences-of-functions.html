<h2>17 Sequences of Functions</h2>
<hr>

<p>We have looked at <a href="16-sequences-and-series.html">sequences and series</a> of
real numbers.  Our next topic, from Section 4.5 in the textbook, is sequences of
functions.</p>

<p>Let $I$ be some subset of $\R$.  Suppose that for each $n\in\N$, $f_n(x)$ is
a function from $I$ to $\R$.  Then $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a 
<span class=nw>sequence of functions</span> on $I$.  Given such a sequence of functions,
for each $x\in I$, we get a sequence of real numbers
$\{f_n(x)\}_{n=1}^\infty$, and we can ask about the convergence of that sequence.
If $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)$ exists for each $x\in I$, then we can define
a function $f$ on $I$ by letting $f(x) = \ds\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)$.
We then say that the sequence of functions, $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, is
is <span class=nw>pointwise convergent</span> on $I$ and that it <span class=nw>converges
pointwise</span> to $f$.</p>

<p>For example, let $I=[0,\infty)$ and let $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{1+nx}$.
Looking at $x=0$, $f_n(0) = 1$ for all $n$, so $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(0) = 0$.
For any $x>0$, $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} (1+nx) = +\infty$ and $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x) = 0$.
We see that the sequence of functions $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges
pointwise on $[0,\infty)$ to the function 
$f(x) =\begin{cases} 0 &\mbox{ if $x=0$}\\ 1 &\mbox{ if $x>0$}\end{cases}$
</p>

<p>Note that we have a sequence of continuous functions that converges to a discontinuous
function.  In fact, for many purposes, pointwise convergence is not a "strong" enough 
form of convergence.  A stronger form is given by "uniform convergence."  Uniform
convergence relates to pointwise convergence similarly to the way uniform continuity
relates to continuity.  That is, the difference between pointwise convergence and
uniform convergence is the order in which quantifiers are applied.  Note that
$\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges pointwise on $I$ to $f$ if for every $\eps>0$
and every $x\in I$, there is a $N\in\N$ (depending on both $\eps$ and $x$)
such that for all $n\ge N$, $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\eps$. For uniform convergence, given an
$\eps>0$ there must exist an $N$, depending on $\eps$, only that works for all $x\in I$.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition</span> Let $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence
of functions defined on the subset $I$ of $\R$, and let $f$ be a function defined on $I$.
We say that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ <span class=nw>converges uniformly</span> to $f$ on $I$
if for all $\eps>0$, there is an $N\in\N$ such that for all $x\in I$ and all $n\ge N$,
$|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\eps$.  We say that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is <span class=nw>uniformly
convergent.</p></div>

<p>Uniform convergence has many nice properties that pointwise convergence lacks.
For example, the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span>
Suppose that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of continuous functions on an
interval $I$, and that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $I$.
Then $f$ is continuous on $I$.</p></div>

<p>Similarly, the integral of a pointwise limit of functions $f_n$ on $[a,b]$
is not necessarily the limit of the integrals $\int_a^bf_n$, even if that
limit exists.  But</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span>
Suppose that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of differentiable functions on the
interval $[a,b]$  and that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[a,b]$.
Then $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and $$\int_a^b f = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_a^b f_n $$
</p></div>

<p>And for derivatives, it is not necessarily true that the derivative of
a pointwise limit is the limit of the derivatives.  However, that will be
the case if the derivative functions converge uniformly.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span>
Suppose that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of continuous functions on the
interval $[a,b]$  and that $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges pointwise to $f$ on $[a,b]$.
Suppose also that the sequence of derivative functions, $\{f_n^\prime\}_{n=1}^\infty$,
converges uniformly on $[a,b]$.  Then $f$ is differentiable and 
$\{f_n^\prime\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges to $f'$ on $[a,b]$.  That is, for all $x\in[a,b]$,
$$f'(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n^\prime(x)$$
