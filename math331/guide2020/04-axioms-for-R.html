<h2>04 Axioms for $\R$</h2>
<hr>

<p>We have looked at <a href="02-dedekind-cuts.html">Dedekind cuts</a> as an explicit
construction of the set of real numbers.  But how do we know that we have properly
captured all of the properties that we would expect $\R$ to have?  We need a list
of properties that express exactly what it means to be "the real numbers."
That list is given in the textbook as a set of fifteen <span class=nw>axioms</span>.
The axioms are statements about a system consisting of a set together with
operations of addition, multiplication, and comparison.  It can be shown that 
any two systems that satisfy the fifteen axioms are essentially the same;
that is, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two sets that preserves
all of the operations.  Probably the most important thing to remember from
Section 1.3 is simply what it means to have an axiomatic specification of
the real numbers.</p>

<p>Just listing the axioms does not show that there
is any system that actually satisfies them. But it can be shown that Dedekind
cuts satisfy the fifteen axioms.  So, we have come at the real numbers from
two directions: We have a set of properties that
completely characterize what we think the real numbers should be, and
we have a particular mathematical object that has all of those properties.
This allows us to say, in some sense, that we understand the real numbers
(although we don't really understand them until we understand all the
consequences of the axioms&mdash;a process that can never really be
completed but that we will start in the <a href="05-applying-the-axioms.html">next&nbsp;section</a>).</p>

<p>The first eleven axioms say that the set of real numbers, together with the
addition and multiplication operations, is a <span class=nw>field</span>.
They define the algebra of the real number system.  The requirement is that
addition and multiplication are <span class=nw>commutative</span> and 
<span class=nw>associative</span>, that <span class=nw>identities</span>
and <span class=nw>inverses</span> exist for both addition and multiplication, 
and multiplication <span class=nw>distributes</span> over addition.  There are
also <span class=nw>closure</span> axioms, which say that the sum and product
of real numbers are also real numbers. Any
system that satisfies the field axioms will automatically have many other algebraic 
properties.  That is, it will have properties that can be <b>proved</b> from
the axioms.  For example, it can be proved that identities and inverses are
unique.</p>

<p>The field axioms do not completely determine the real numbers.
There are many other fields, including $\Q$, the set of rational numbers, and
$\C$, the set of complex numbers.  The set $\{a+b\sqrt{2}\,|\,a,b\in\R\}$
is a field.  So is $\big\{\frac{p(\pi)}{q(\pi)}\,\big|\,p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are
polynomials with rational coefficients and $q(x)$ is not the zero polynomial$\big\}.$
For all of the these sets, the addition and multiplication operations are
the usual operations for numbers.</p>

<p>There are also finite fields.  You are probably familiar with 
$\Z_n$, the set $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$ with the operations of addition
and multiplication $mod\;\,n$.  For a prime number $p$, $\Z_p$ is
a field.</p>

<p>And there are algebraic systems that are not fields.  The set $\Z$ of
integers is not a field because not every integer has a multiplicative
inverse in $\Z$.  The set $\N$ of natural numbers is even further from
being a field, because it is missing both additive and multiplicative inverses.
The set $\Z_n$, where $n$ is not prime, is not a field. (Suppose
$n$ factors as $n=ab$ where both $a$ and $b$ are strictly between
1 and $n.$  Then $b$ has no multiplicative inverse in $\Z_n$.
For if <span class=nb>$bx=1$ ($mod\;\,n$)</span>, then
<span class=nb>$0=0x=nx=abx=a1=a$ ($mod\;\,n$)</span>,
but in fact <span class=nb>$a\ne0$ ($mod\;\,n$)</span> because $a$
is strictly between 1 and $n$.)</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>$\R$ is not just a field; it is an <span class=nw>ordered field</span>.
There is an operator $&lt;$ for comparing two real numbers.  The
properties of this operation are expressed by three axioms, which 
are actually properties of the set of positive numbers:
There is a subset $P$ of $\R$ that is closed under addition and
multiplication and $\R$ is a disjoint union of $P$, $\{0\}$,
and $-P.$  Given the set $P$, the comparison operation is defined
by saying $x&lt;y$ if and only if $y-x\in P.$  The set $P$ is
that set of <span class="nw">positive</span> elements of $\R$,
and $-P=\{-a\,|\,a\in P\}$, the set of <span class="nw">negative</span>
elements. </p>

<p>But there are other ordered fields besides $\R$, such as the
rational numbers or indeed any field that is a proper subset of $\R$.
The final piece to completely characterize the real numbers is
<span class=nw>completeness</span>, which can be expressed by
the <a href="03-least-upper-bound-axiom.html">least upper bound axiom</a>.
This axiom means, intuitively, that there are no "holes" in the
real number line.  As we have seen, it also implies the Archimedian
property of the real numbers:  There
is no real number $x$ that is greater than every natural number.  
(Note that the field of rational numbers is Archimedian but is not 
complete, so the Archimedian property does not imply completeness.)</p>

<hr class=break>

$\newcommand{\F}{{\mathbb F}}$

<p>The Archimedian property might seem very natural to you, so
it is interesting to look at an ordered field that is not Archimedian.
For that, we can use rational functions $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$
where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials with real coefficients and
$q(x)$ is not the zero polynomial.  Note that we have to consider
two rational functions $\frac{p_1(x)}{q_1(x)}$ and $\frac{p_2(x)}{q_2(x)}$
to be equivalent if they can be made equal by dividing out common factors
from the numerator and denominator of each fraction.  Every rational
function is then equivalent to one of the form $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ where
$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ have no common factors of degree greater than zero
and the leading coefficient of $q(x)$ is&nbsp;1.  [The leading coefficient of a polynomial
is the constant factor in the term in which $x$ has the highest degree in that polynomial.]
With that understanding,
we let $\F$ be the set of rational functions with real coefficients,
with the usual addition and multiplication of functions.</p>

<p>Note that a real number $a$ can be considered to be the rational
function $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ where $p(x)=a$ and $q(x)=1$.  So we can
consider $\R$ to be a subset of $\F$.  Since $\frac a1\cdot \frac b1 = \frac{ab}1$
and $\frac a1 + \frac b1 = \frac{a+b}1$, addition and multiplication of
real numbers are the same in $\F$ as in $\R.$  That is, $\R$ is actually
a subfield of $\F$.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span>The field of rational functions, $\F$, 
is a non-Archimedian ordered field.</p></div>
<div class=prf><p><span class=dtp>Proof:</span>
We give a brief outline of the proof.  It is not hard to show that $\F$ satisfies the eleven field axioms.
To make it into an ordered field, we need to define the set of 
positive elements in $\F$.  We define $P=\big\{\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\,\big|\,$the
leading coefficient of $q(x)$ is 1 and $p(x)$ is non-zero and has a positive leading
coefficient$\big\}$.  We have to check that $P$ satisfies the three ordering
axioms.  Recalling that any rational function can be written
as a fraction in which the denominator has leading coefficient 1, it is clear
that any rational function $r(x)$ satisfies exactly one of $r(x)\in P$,
$r(x)=0$, or $-r(x)\in P$.  To see that $P$ is closed under addition and
multiplication, suppose $r(x)=\frac{ax^n+\cdots}{x^m+\cdots}$
and $s(x)=\frac{bx^k+\cdots}{x^\ell+\cdots}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive and 
in each case <span class=nb>"$\dots$"</span> represents terms of lower degree. Then
$$r(x) \cdot s(x) = \frac{ax^n+\cdots}{x^m+\cdots} \cdot \frac{bx^k+\cdots}{x^\ell+\cdots} =
         \frac{abx^{n+k}+\cdots}{x^{m+\ell}+\cdots}$$
and so $r(x)\cdot s(x)\in P$ since $ab>0$.  For addition,
$$\begin{align*}
   r(x) + s(x) &= \frac{ax^n+\cdots}{x^m+\cdots} + \frac{bx^k+\cdots}{x^\ell+\cdots} \\[8pt]
       &= \frac{(x^\ell+\cdots)(ax^n+\cdots)+(x^m+\cdots)(bx^k+\cdots)}{(x^m+\cdots)(x^\ell+\cdots)}\\[8pt]
       &= \frac{ax^{\ell+n}+b^{k+m}+\cdots}{x^{m+\ell}+\cdots}
\end{align*}$$
and so $r(x)+s(x)\in P$ because the leading coefficient in the numerator is either $a$ or $b$ or $a+b$
(depending on whether $\ell+n$ is greater than or less than or equal to $k+m$),
and all of these are positive.</p>
<p>To see that $\F$ is not Archimedian, consider the rational function $\frac x1$ (where the
numerator, $x$, is the polynomial $p(x)=x$). We claim that for every natural number $n$, $\frac n1&lt;\frac x1$.
(In $\F$, the natural number $n$ becomes the rational fraction $\frac n1$.)
By definition, $\frac n1 &lt;\frac x1$ means that  $\frac x1 - \frac n1 \in P$. 
But $\frac x1 - \frac n1 = \frac{x-n}{1}$, and the fact that the leading coefficient
of the numerator is positive means that $\frac{x-n}{1}\in P$.
We have shown that $\frac x1$ is an element of $\F$ that is greater than every natural number,
which means $\F$ is non-Archimedian. $\qed$
</p></div>

<p>It is also true in $\F$ that $\frac 1x &lt; \frac 1n$ for any integer $n$, so there
are elements of $\F$ that are greater than zero but less than $\frac 1n$ for every
integer $n$.</p>

<p>You can try to imagine all the elements of $\F$ laid out in a linear order, with $\R$ as a
small bit in the middle.  Any rational function in which the degree of the numerator is
greater than the degree of the denominator lies to the left or to the right of $\R$.
Any rational function in which the degree of the numerator is smaller than the
degree of the denominator lies within $\R$, infinitely close but not equal to zero.
I will leave you to find the rational functions in which the degrees of the numerator
and denominator are equal.  We started our investigation of the real numbers by
identifying $\R$ as "the real line."  But we had only some intuitions about what
"the real line" should mean.  Is it possible that $\F$ would be a better model for
the real numbers, instead of the set of Dedekind cuts?  Maybe so, but it would mean
giving up the least upper bound axiom, which is the basis of most of the things 
that we will prove about real numbers in this course.</p>
