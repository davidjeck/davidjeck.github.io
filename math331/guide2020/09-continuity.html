<h2>09 Continuity and Uniform Continuity</h2>
<hr>

<p>Continuity is often defined in terms of limits, but continuity is actually
the easier concept to work with, and it can be defined directly with a
definition similar to the definition of limit.  There are several equivalent
ways to express the continuity of a function at a point.

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span>
Let $a\in \R$, and suppose that $f(x)$ is a function defined on an open interval 
containing $a$ (including at $a$).  Then $f$ is <span class=nw>continuous at $a$</span>
if it satisfies any, and hence all, of the following equivalent conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>for any $\eps>0$, there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x-a|<\delta$ then $|f(x)-f(a)|<\eps$</li>
<li>$\ds\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists and $\ds\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$</li>
<li>$\ds\lim_{h\to 0}f(a+h)$ exists, and $\lim_{h\to 0}(f(a+h)-f(a)) = 0$.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class=np>It is also convenient to define <span class=nw>continuity from the left</span>
and <span class=nw>continuity from the right</span> at $a$ in the obvious way, using
the limits of $f(a)$ from the left and from the right at $a$.</p>

<p>We then define <span class=nw>continuity of $f(x)$ on an open interval $(a,b)$</span>
to mean continuity at every point in $(a,b)$, and <span class=nw>continuity on a closed
interval $[a,b]$</span> to mean continuity on the open interval $(a,b)$ plus continuity
from the left at $a$ and continuity from the right at $b$.</p>

<p>Rules for continuity of the sum, product, and so on follow easily from the corresponding
rules for limits.  There is also an important new rule for continuity of composition
of functions.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span>
Let $f$ and $g$ be functions, and $a\in\R$.  Suppose that $g(x)$ is continuous at $a$ and
$f(x)$ is continuous at $f(a)$.  Then $f\circ g$ is continuous at $a$.
</p></div>

<p>Continuity on a bounded, closed interval has several important consequences, including
the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) and the Extreme Value Theorem (EVT). The IVT seems clearly
to depend on the completeness (or "no-holes") property of $\R$, and it can be
proved using the least upper bound axiom.

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Intermediate Value Theorem)</span>
Suppose that $f(x)$ is a continuous function on the closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$.
If $y$ is some number satisfying $f(a)&lt;y&lt;f(b)$, then there is some $c\in(a,b)$
such that $f(c) = y$.  The same holds if $f(a)>y>f(b)$.
</p></div>
<div class=prf><p><span class=dtp>Proof:</span>
We prove the first assertion; the second is similar.  Define $X=\{x\in[a,b]\,|\,f(x)&lt;y\}$.
We know that $a\in X$, by the assumption that $f(a)&lt;y$.  And $X$ has upper bound $b$ by its definition.
So, by the Least Upper Bound Axiom, $X$ has a least upper bound, $\lambda$.  Note that
$\lambda\in[a,b]$.  We show $f(\lambda)=y$ by proving that $f(\lambda)&lt;y$ and
$f(\lambda)>y$ are both impossible.</p>

<p>Suppose that $f(\lambda)&lt;y$.  So, $y-f(\lambda)>0$.  
Note that since $f(\lambda)&lt;y&lt;f(b)$, we know $\lambda&lt;b$ and
$f$ is continuous from the right at $\lambda$.  Since
$f$ is continuous from the right at $\lambda$, then (taking $\eps=y-f(\lambda)$
in the definition of continuity)
there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x$,
if $\lambda&lt;x&lt;\lambda+\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(\lambda)|&lt;y-f(\lambda)$.  This
is equivalent to $-(y-f(\lambda))&lt;f(x)-f(\lambda)&lt;y-f(\lambda)$.  
In particular, adding $f(\lambda)$ to the second inequality, $f(x)&lt;y$ and therefore $x\in X$.
Taking any particular $x\in(\lambda,\lambda+\delta)$,
the fact that $x\in X$ contradicts the fact that $\lambda$ is an upper bound for $X$.
[The picture here is that if $f(\lambda)&lt;y$, then $f(x)$ is pulled less than $y$
for some $x$'s that are bigger than $\lambda$ and those $x$'s are in $X$, which is
impossible since they are bigger than $lub(X)$.]</p>

<p>Now suppose that $f(\lambda)>y$.  So, $f(\lambda)-y>0$.  Note that
since $f(\lambda)>y>f(a)$, we know $\lambda>a$ and $f$ is continuous from the
left at $\lambda$.  Therefore, there is some $\delta>0$ such that for all $x$,
if $\lambda-\delta&lt;x&lt;\lambda$, then $|f(x)-f(\lambda)|&lt;f(\lambda)-y$,
which is equivalent to $-(f(\lambda)-y)&lt;f(x)-f(\lambda)&lt;f(\lambda)-y$.
In particular, using the first inequality, $f(x)>y$.  This means $x\notin X$
for all $x\in(\lambda-\delta,\lambda)$. But that contradicts the fact that
$\lambda=lub(X)$ (since it means that there is no element of $X$ greater than
$\lambda-\delta$).
[The picture here is that if $f(\lambda)>y$, then $f(x)$ is pulled greater than $y$
for all $x$'s just to the left of $y$, which means any of those $x$'s would be
a smaller lower bound for $X$.]

<p>The Extreme Value Theorem could be proved directly from the Heine-Borel Theorem, but
the textbook chooses to use uniform continuity, which is itself an important new
concept.  Uniform continuity on an interval is a stronger form of continuity
that requires that, for a given $\eps>0$, the same $\delta$ will work for all the
points in the interval in the definition of continuity.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> Suppose that the function $f$ is defined on
an interval $I$.  We say that $f$ is <span class=nw>uniformly continuous</span> on
$I$ if for every $\eps>0$, there is a $\delta>0$ such that for any $x,y\in I$,
if $|x-y|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|<\eps$.
</p></div>

<p>The big theorem is that continuity on a closed, bounded interval implies uniform continuity
on that interval.  The proof that is given in the textbook uses the Heine-Borel Theorem, 
and it is similar to other proofs that we have seen that use that theorem.  The EVT can
then be proved using uniform continuity (again, you can refer to the proof in the textbook, where
the EVT is called the Max-Min Theorem).</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> Let $f$ be a continuous function on a
closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$.  Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$.</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Extreme Value Theorem):</span> Let $f$ be a continuous 
function on a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$.  Then there are points $m, M\in [a,b]$
such that for all $x\in [a,b]$, $f(m)\le f(x)\le f(M)$.</p></div>

<p class=np>The function values $f(m)$ and $f(M)$ are the minimum and maximum values of
$f$ on the interval $[a,b]$.  The content of the theorem is that, first of all, the
function is bounded on $[a,b]$ so that the set of function values $\{f(x)\,|\,x\in[a,b]\}$
has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound, and second that the function actually
achieves those bounds.  Note that, in general, when $glb(X)\in X$, then we can refer to
the $glb(X)$ as the minimum of $X$, and when $lub(X)\in X$, then we can refer to the
$lub(X)$ as the maximum of $X$.</p>
