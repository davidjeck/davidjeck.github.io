<h2>14 Properties of the Integral and the Fundamental Theorems</h2>
<hr>

<p>Having defined the <a href="13-riemann-integral.html">Riemann integral</a>, we are in
a position to prove the major theorems about it, starting with some integrability conditions.
The first theorem provides an easier way to show that a function is integrable.
The idea is that $\ds \sup_P\{U(P,f)\} = \inf_P\{L(P,f\}$ if and only if some specific $U(Q,f)$ can
be made arbitrarily close to $L(Q,f)$.
</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem:</span>  Let $f$ be a bounded function on
$[a,b]$.  Then $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ if and only if for every $\eps>0$, there
is a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,f)-L(P,f)<\eps$.
</p></div>

<p class=np>Based on this theorem, it is fairly easy to prove that certain kinds of
functions are integrable:</p>


<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem:</span>
Let $f$ be a function defined on $[a,b]$.  Then if is itegrable if it satisfies any of the
following properties:  $f$ is continuous, $f$ is non-decreasing, or $f$ is non-increasing.
[Note that a function that satisfies any of these properties is automatically bounded.]
</p></div>

<p class=np>Note that the set of integrable functions will include some pretty crazy
functions.  For example, there are continuous functions that are not differentiable at
any point.  And there are increasing functions that have a jump discontinuity at
every rational number.  However, not every function is integrable.  For example,
Dirichlet's function, which is 1 at every irrational number and 0 at every rational
number, is not integrable on any interval.</p>

<p>We are also in a position to prove the basic theorems about integration,
leading up to the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, which give the relationship
between integration and differentiation.</p>


<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem (Additivity of the Integral):</span>
Suppose that $f$ is defined on $[a,b]$ and $c\in(a,b)$.  Then $f$ is integrable
on $[a,b]$ if and only if it is integrable on both $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$.  And if
$f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$, then $$\int_a^b f = \int_a^c f + \int_c^b f$$
</p></div>

<p class=np>To remove the restriction that $a&lt;c&lt;b$ in this formula, we define
$\int_a^bf$ for $a=b$ and for $a&lt;b$.  With this definition, it is easy to
see that the additivity formula holds for any $a,b,c$ as long as $f$ is
integrable on an interval that contains all three numbers.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class="dtp">Definition:</span>
If $f$ is a function that is defined at $a$, then we define $\ds\int_a^a f=0$.  If $f$ is 
integrable on the interval $[b,a]$, then we define $\ds\int_a^b f=-\int_b^a f$.
</p></div>


<p class=np>The "linearity" of the integral says that integration is a linear function,
in the sense of linear algebra,  from the set of all integrable functions on $[a,b]$
to $\R$.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem (Linearity of the Integral):</span>
Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are integrable functions on $[a,b]$ and that $r,s\in\R$.
Then the function $rf+sg$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and
$$\int_a^b(rf+sg) = r\int_a^b f\ \ +\ \ s\int_a^b g$$
</p></div>


<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem (Mean Value Theorem for Integrals):</span>
If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then there is a $c\in[a,b]$ such that $$\int_a^b = f(c)\cdot(b-a)$$
</p></div>


<p>The last of the major theorems about integrable functions are the Fundamental
Theorems of Calculus.  The first Fundamental Theorem makes it possible to 
find the integral of any function that has an antiderivative.  The second shows
that any continuous function does, in fact, have an antiderivative.

<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem (First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus):</span>
Suppose that $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and that there is function $g$ that satisfies
$g'(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in[a,b]$.  (So, $g$ is an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$.)
Then $$\int_a^b f = g(b)-g(a)$$
</p></div>



<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem (Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus):</span>
Suppose that $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.  For $x\in [a,b]$, Define $$F(x) = \int_a^x f$$
Then $F'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x\in[a,b]$.
</p></div>
