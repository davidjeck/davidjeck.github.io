<h2>09 Metric Spaces</h2>
<hr>

<p>We will take a break from the textbook before moving on to Chapter 3, to
look at a topic not covered in the book:  
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/metric-spaces/index.html">metric&nbsp;spaces</a>.
Basic properties of metric spaces are covered in the readings
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/metric-spaces/open-and-closed-sets.html">Open and Closed Sets</a>
and <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/metric-spaces/subspaces-and-product-spaces.html">Subspaces and Product Spaces</a> 
(but we will not spend any time on product spaces).
</p>

<p>A metric space is a set together with a measure of distance between pairs of
points in that set.  A basic example is the set of real numbers with the usual
notion of distance, where the distance between $a$ and $b$ is $|a-b|$.
In the general definition of metric spaces, some basic properties of absolute value are
used as the defining axioms.  The triangle inequality plays a prominent role.
</p>

<div class="def"><p><span class="dtp" id="D-metric-space">Definition:</span> A <span class=nw>metric space</span>
is a pair $(M,d)$ where $M$ is a set and $d$ is a function $d\colon M\times M\to\R$ satisfying:</p>
<ol>
<li>$d(x,y)\ge0$, for all $x,y\in M$;</li>
<li>$d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x=y$;</li>
<li>symmetry: $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$, for all $x,y\in M$; and</li>
<li>the triangle inequality: $d(x,z)\le d(x,y)+d(y,z)$, for all $x,y,z\in M$.</li>
</ol>
<p>The function $d$ is said to be a <span class="nw">metric</span> on $M$.</p>
</div>

<p>So, $(\R,d)$ is a metric space with $d(a,b)=|a-b|$.  $\R^n$ becomes the metric space
$(\R^n,\rho)$ with the usual notion of distance, 
$$\rho\big((x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n),(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)\big)=\sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2+(x_2-y_2)^2+\cdots+x_n-y_n)^2\,}$$
But there are other distance measures on $\R^n$ that also make it into a metric space, such as
$$\rho\big((x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n),(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)\big)=\max\big(|x_1-y_1|,|x_2-y_2|,\cdots,|x_n-y_n|\big)$$
</p>

<p>There are common metrics on other sets that you might not ordinarily think
of in terms of distance.  For example on the set
$\mathscr C([a,b],\R)$ of continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[a,b]$,
we can define a distance measure $\mu(f,g)=\ds\max_{x\in[a,b]}|f(x)-g(x)|$.</p>

<p>In any metric space, we can talk about "open" and "closed" sets.  In $\R$, we
defined a set $\mathcal O$ to be open if for every $x\in\mathcal O$, there is an $\eps>0$
such that the open interval $(x-\eps,x+\eps)$ is a contained in $\mathcal O$.
Equivalently, $\mathcal O$ is open if it is a union of open intervals.  We haven't
defined closed sets in $\R$, only closed intervals, but the general definition is easy:
A closed set $\mathcal F$ is closed if its complement, $\R\smallsetminus \mathcal F$, is open.
(Note, by the way, that it is <b>not</b> true that every closed set is a union of
closed intervals; it is not even true that a union of closed intervals has to be closed.)
All of these definitions extend to arbitrary metric spaces, starting with "open ball,"
which is the generalization of an open interval of the form $(x-\eps,x+\eps)$.</p>


<div class="def"><p><span class="dtp" id="D-open-ball">Definition:</span>
Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space.  For $a\in M$ and $r>0,$ we define
the <span class=nw>open ball about $a$ of radius $r$</span> to be the
set $B_r^d(a) = \{x\in M\;|\;d(x,a) &lt; r\}.$ (When the metric is clear
from context, $B_r^d(a)$ can be written $B_r(a)$.)</p></div>

<div class="def"><p><span class="dtp" id="D-open">Definition:</span>
Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space.
A subset $X$ of $M$ is said to be <span class="nw">open</span> in $(M,d)$ if and only 
if for every $a\in X,$ there is an $\eps>0$ such that 
$B_\eps(a)\subseteq X.$
</p></div>

<div class="def"><p><span class="dtp" id="D-closed">Definition:</span>
Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space.  A subset $X$ of $M$ is said to be <span class=nw>closed</span>
if its complement, $M\smallsetminus X$, is open.</p></div>

<p class=np>Note that a set can be neither open non closed, like the interval $[0,1)$ in $\R$, and
a set can be both open and closed, something that is true in any metric space $M$ for the sets
$M$ and $\varnothing$.</p>

<p>When thinking about metric spaces, and trying to understand them more intuitively,
the one-dimensional metric space $\R$ is a little too restrictive to capture the full intuition.
Usually, the picture to have in mind is $\R^2$ with its 
usual metric, in which $B_r(a)$ is the disk with center $a$ and radius $r$, not including the
boundary of the disk, as shown in this illustration:</p>

<p style="text-align:center" class=np><img src="figures/10-fig1.png" width=478 height=302></p>

<p class=np>The discrete metric, which is defined and examined in several exercises in the
reading, is another good example to keep in mind, since it is so different from $\R^n$.
It provides some counterexamples to things that you might have expected to be true in
all metric spaces.</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>The collection of open sets in a metric space $(M,d)$ includes $\varnothing$ and $M$, 
is closed under arbitrary (possibly infinite) union, and is closed under finite intersection. 
That is, any union of open sets is open, and any intersection of a finite number of
open sets is open.  These properties
mean that the collection of open sets in $M$ form a <span class=nw>topology</span> for
$M$ and make $M$ into a <span class=nw>topological space</span>.  Properties of metric
spaces that can be defined purely in terms of open sets are said to be "topological
properties," because they can be generalized to more general topological spaces.</p>

<p>The collection of closed sets in a metric space includes $\varnothing$ and $M$,
is closed under finite union, and is closed under arbitrary intersection.
There is an alternative definition for closed sets, in terms of accumulation points,
which are defined in general metric spaces analogously to their definition in $\R$.</p>

<div class="def"><p><span class="dtp" id="D-accumulation">Definition:</span>
Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space, let $X\subseteq M,$ and let $x\in X.$  Then $x$ is an
<span class="nw">accumulation point</span> of $X$ if
for every $\varepsilon>0,$ $X\cap (B_\varepsilon(x)\smallsetminus \{x\}) \ne \varnothing.$
That is, for any $\varepsilon>0,$ there is at least one element of $X,$ other than $x$ itself, that is within
distance $\varepsilon$ of&nbsp;$x.$
</p></div>

<div class="thm"><p><span class="dtp" id="T-closed-if">Theorem:</span>
Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space, and let $X\subseteq M.$  $X$ is closed
if and only if every accumulation point of $X$ is an element of $X.$
</p></div>

<p>For any subset $A$ of a metric space $M$, the <span class=nw>closure of $A$</span>,
which we will denote as $\overline{A}$, is defined to be the set that consists of
$A$ together with all accumulation points of $A$.  The closure of a set is in fact
a closed set; it is the smallest closed set that contains $A$.
If $F$ is already a closed set, then $\overline{F}=F$.</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>If $(M,d)$ is a metric space and $X$ is a subset of $M$, it is natural to make
$X$ into a metric space by using the same measure of distance in $X$ as is used in
$M$.  That is, for $x,y\in X$, the distance from $x$ to $y$ in $X$ is taken to
be $d(x,y)$, just like it is in $M$.  With this metric, $X$ is said to be
a <span class=nw>subspace</span> of $M$.</p>

<p>It is important to understand how open and closed sets work in subspaces.
If $X$ is a subspace of $M$, a subset $\mathcal U$ of $X$ is open in $X$ if and
only if there is an open set $\mathcal O$ in $M$ such that $\mathcal U = X\cap \mathcal O$.
That is, open sets in $X$ are intersections of $X$ with open setsets of $M$.
Similarly, closed sets in $X$ are intersections of $X$ with closed subsets of $M$.</p>

<p>For example, the interval $[0,1]$ can be considered to be a subspace of $\R$.
In this subspace, $[0,1/2)$ is an open set since it is the intersection of $[0,1]$
with (for example) the open subset $(-1/2,1/2)$ of $\R$.  (It can also be seen to
be open by noting that $[0,1/2)$ is equal to the open ball of radius $1/2$ about $0$ in $[0,1).)$</p>

<p>If we make $\Q$ into a subspace of $\R$, we see that the set $\{q\in\Q\,|\,q^2&lt;2\}$
is both open and closed in $\Q$, since it is the intersection of $\Q$ with both the open
interval $(-\sqrt2,\sqrt2)$ and with the closed interval $[-\sqrt2,\sqrt2]$.</p>
