<h2>13 The Definite Integral, $\int_a^b f$</h2>
<hr>

<p>The second part of calculus, after <a href="11-derivatives.html">differentiation</a>
is <span class=nw>integration</span>.  We want to define the definite integral of a bounded function
$f$ on a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$.  In fact, however, not every function
is integrable.</p>

<p>Mathematicians actually use several
different definitions of integral.  The one that you are familiar with from Calculus II
is the Riemann integral, defined using Riemann sums.  More common in advanced
mathematics is the Lebesgue integral, which has some nice properties that Riemann
integrals lack.  However, every function that is Riemann integral is also Lebesgue integrable,
with the same value, and Riemann integrals are easier to understand.  We will study the
Riemann integral, but using a definition
of Riemann integral that extends naturally to the definition of Lebesgue integral.</p>

<p>The type of integral used in the textbook, defined using upper and lower sums,
is actually the Darboux integral.  It is equivalent to the usual definition of 
Riemann integral that you probably saw in Calculus II:
$$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{\max(\Delta x_i)\to 0}\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i*)\Delta x_i$$
However, the Darboux definition is easier to work with.  To lead up to the
definition, we start by defining partitions\dots</p>

<div class=def><a><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> A <span class=nw>partition</span> of a closed bounded interval
$[a,b]$ is a finite set $\{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ such that $a=x_0&lt;x_1&lt;\cdots&lt;x_n = b$.
We will often denote the length of the $i^{\rm th}$ subinterval, $[x_{i-1},x_i]$,  by $\Delta x_i$.</p></div>

<p>The Calculus II idea of Riemann integration is to take $\xi_i\in[x_{i-1},x_i]$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$, and
to use $\sum_{i=1}^nf(\xi_i)\Delta x_i$ as an approximation for $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$.  The sum is referred to
as a Riemann sum.  To get the exact value of the integral, you have to let the size of the subintervals 
approach zero.  This is not really a very well-defined kind of limit.  We use a different approach,
using a particular choice of Riemann sum.</p>

<p>Note that at this point, for no good reason, our textbook starts using the notation "sup" instead of "lub" and
"inf" instead of "glb".  ("Sup" stands for "supremum" and "inf" stands for "infimum".)
The meanings, in this context, are the same, but I would also allow sup and inf to be used on unbounded sets,
with $\pm\infty$ as possible values.  Note that the following definition requires that the function be
bounded.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> Suppose that $f$ is a bounded function on the
closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$, and that $P=\{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ is a partition of $[a,b]$.
For $i=1,2,\dots,n$, let $M_i = \sup\{f(x)\,|\,x_{i-1}\le x\le x_i\}$ and let
$m_i = \inf\{f(x)\,|\,x_{i-1}\le x\le x_i\}$.  We define the <span class=nw>upper sum of $f$ relative to
the partition $P$</span> as $$U(P,f)=\sum_{i=1}^n M_i\cdot(x_i-x_{i-1})$$ and we define 
the <span class=nw>lower sum of $f$ relative to
the partition $P$</span> as $$L(P,f)=\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\cdot(x_i-x_{i-1})$$</p></div>

<p>An upper sum overestimates the integral of $f$.  A lower sum underestimates the integral of $f$.
The idea for the Riemann integral of $f$ is to take the inf of all possible upper sums, $\ds\inf_P\{U(P,f)\}$,
and the sup of all possible lower sums $\ds\sup_P\{L(P,f)\}$.  If those two values are the same, then
the function is Riemann integrable and the integral of $f$ is defined to be their common value.
To make this rigorous, we first need to define a refinement of a partition.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> Let $P$ and $R$ be partitions of $[a,b]$.
We say that $R$ is a <span class=nw>refinement</span> of $P$ if $R\subseteq P$.</p></div>

<p>It is not too hard to see that refining a partition can decrease the associated upper sum
of a function and increase the lower sum.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> Let $P$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ and let
$R$ be a refinement of $P$.  Then $$L(P,f)\le L(R,f)\le U(R,f) \le U(P,f)$$.</p></div>

<p>Note that this means that the set of all possible lower sums of a function is bounded above
by any individual upper sum, and the set of all possible upper sums of a function is bounded above
by any individual lower sum.  So we have</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> Let $f$ be a bounded function on $[a,b]$,
and let $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ be any partitions of $[a,b]$.  Then $$L(Q_1,f)\le \sup_P\{L(P,f)\}
\le \inf_P\{U(P,f)\}\le U(Q_2,f)$$</p></div>

<p class=np>We are now ready to define the integral</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> Let $f$ be a bounded function on $[a,b]$.
We say that $f$ is <span class=nw>Riemann integrable</span> on $[a,b]$ if
$\ds\sup_P\{L(Q,f)\} = \inf_P\{U(P,f)\}$, and in that case we define the <span class=nw>Riemann integral</span>
of $f$ on $[a,b]$ to be their common value.  The Riemann integral of $f$ on $[a,b]$ is
denoted $\int_a^b f$ or $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$.</p></div>

<p>We should note that there are functions that are <b>not</b> Riemann integrable.  An obvious example
is Dirichlet's function 
$D(x)=\begin{cases}0&\mbox{ if $x$ is irrational}\\1&\mbox{ if $x$ is rational}\end{cases}$.  
Note that every upper sum for $D$ on the interval $[0,1]$ has value 1 while every lower
sum has value 0. So, $\sup_P\{L(Q,D)\} = 0$ while $\inf_P\{U(P,f)\} = 1$.  Since the values
are not equal, $D$ is not Riemann integrable.</p>

<p>We will see that every continuous function is Riemann integrable.  Also, every non-increasing
or non-decreasing function is Riemann integrable.</p>

<p>Since the only kind of definite integral that we will cover is the Riemann (or Darboux) integral, 
I will generally drop "Riemann" from "Riemann integral" and "Riemann integrable."
