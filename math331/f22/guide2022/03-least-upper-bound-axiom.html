<h2>03 Least Upper Bound Property</h2>

<hr>

<p><a href="02-dedekind-cuts.html">Dedekind cuts</a> are a way of constructing a specific
set that represents the real numbers.  But just having that set doesn't provide a full
understanding of the real numbers, even after defining such basic operations as
addition, multiplication, and less than.  One property that really distinguishes
the real numbers is called "completeness," the idea that there are no gaps in the
real numbers.  And one way to express completeness is the <span class=nw>least upper
bound property</span>.  The other important ideas in Section 1.2 are the
Archimedean property of the real numbers and the fact that the rational
numbers are <span class=nw>dense</span> in the real numbers.</p>

<p>A subset of $\R$ is "bounded" if it does not stretch off to infinity.  This intuitive
idea is made precise by the following definitions:</p>

<div class="def"><p><span class="dtp" id="D-bounded">Definition:</span>
Let $X$ be a subset of $\R.$  An <span class="nw">upper bound</span> for $X$ is
a number $b$ such that $x\le b$ for all $x\in X.$  If an upper bound exists for
$X,$ then $X$ is said to be <span class="nw">bounded above</span>.
Similarly, a <span class="nw">lower bound</span> for $X$ is
a number $c$ such that $x\ge c$ for all $x\in X.$  If a lower bound exists for
$X,$ then $X$ is said to be <span class="nw">bounded below</span>. If $X$ is bounded both
above and below, then $X$ is said to be <span class="nw">bounded</span>.
</p></div>

<p class=np>A "least upper bound" for a set is then an upper bound that is as small
as possible.  That is, it is an upper bound that is smaller than every other upper bound.
Greatest lower bounds are defined similarly.</p>

<div class="def">
<p><span class="dtp" id="D-lub">Definition:</span>
Let $X$ be a subset of $\R$ that is bounded above.  A <span class="nw">least upper bound</span> for
$X$ is an upper bound $\lambda$ for $X$ such that for every upper bound $b$ of $X,$ $\lambda\le b.$
Similarly, a <span class="nw">greatest lower bound</span> for
$X$ is a lower bound $\mu$ for $X$ such that for every lower bound $c$ of $X,$ $\mu\ge c.$
</div>

<p class=np>The least upper bound property can then be proved as a theorem about the set of real
numbers, defined as the set of Dedekind cuts.</p>

<div class="thm">
<p><span class="dtp" id="T-lub">Theorem</span> (Least Upper Bound Property):  Every non-empty
subset of $\R$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound.</p>
</div>

<p class=np>The easy proof for Dedekind cuts shows that the least upper bound of a non-empty,
bounded-above set $X$ of Dedekind cuts is obtained by taking the union of all the Dedekind cuts
in $X.$  The proof is in the textbook.</p>

<p>Note that the Greatest Lower Bound Property follows from the Least Upper Bound Property.
That is, every non-empty subset of $\R$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.
(Proof: If $X$ is a non-empty, bounded-below subset of $\R,$ let $X^-=\{-x\,|\,x\in X\}.$
Then $X^-$ is bounded above because for any lower bound $c$ of $X,$ the number $-c$
is an upper bound for $X^-.$ So, $X^-$ has a least upper bound, $\lambda.$  It follows easily
that $-\lambda$ is a greatest lower bound for $X.$)</p>

<p>We will use the least upper bound property many times to prove various important
facts about the real numbers.  The first example is the Archimedean property, which
says that the set of natural numbers, $\N,$ is not bounded above.  That is,
there is no real number that is larger than every natural number.  (My definition
is a little different from the book's.)

<div class="thm"><p><span class="dtp">Theorem</span> (Archimedean Property of $\R$):
For any real number $x\in X,$ there is a natural number, $n$ such that $x&lt;n.$</p></div>
<div class="prf"><p><span class="dtp">Proof</span>: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction,
that $x$ is a real number and $x>n$ for every $n\in\N.$  Then $x$ is an upper bound for $\N.$
Since $\N$ is a non-empty set that is bounded above, then by the least upper bound
property, $\N$ has a least upper bound, $\lambda.$  But consider $\lambda-1.$
For $n\in \N,$ $n+1$ is also in $\N.$  Since $\lambda$ is an upper bound for $\N,$
$\lambda \ge n+1.$  It follows that $\lambda-1\ge n.$  Since this is true for all $n\in\N,$
$\lambda-1$ is an upper bound for $\N.$  But $\lambda-1&lt;\lambda,$ and this contradicts
the fact that $\lambda$ is the <b>least</b> upper bound for $\N.$  This contradiction proves
that $\N$ cannot be bounded above, and that no such $x$ can exist.&nbsp;$\qed$</p></div>

<p class=np>The book's statement of the Archimedean property is that for any two positive real
numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta,$ there is a natural number $n$ such that $n\alpha>\beta.$
If we let $x=\frac{\beta}{\alpha},$ then my theorem gives a natural number $n$ such
that $\frac{\beta}{\alpha}&lt;n,$ which is equivalent to $n\alpha>\beta.$</p>

<p>The Archimedean property of $\R$ can be used to prove that the rational numbers
are dense in the real numbers.  That is for any two real numbers $a$ and
$b,$ there is a rational number $r$ such that $a&lt;r&lt;b.$  The proof is in
the textbook (but is not especially important).  Another way of expressing
the density of the rational numbers is that for any $x\in\R$ and $\eps>0,$
there is an $r\in\Q$ such that $0&lt;|x-r|&lt;\eps$; that is, there is a
rational number, not equal to $x$ itself, within distance $\eps$ of $x.$</p>


<hr class="break">

<p>It is easy to see that the least upper bound of a set is unique.  That is, a set can have
only one least upper bound.  Another way of saying this is that if $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are
least upper bounds for a set $X,$ then $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ must be the same.
For, suppose that $X$ is a non-empty set that is bounded above, and suppose that
$\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ both satisfy the least upper bound property for $X.$
Since a least upper bound is, in particular, an upper bound, we have that $\lambda_2$ is an upper bound
for $X$.  Since $\lambda_2$ is an upper bound and $\lambda_1$ is a least upper bound, we have
by the least upper bound property for $\lambda_1,$ that
$\lambda_1\le\lambda_2.$  But, for the same reason, we also have $\lambda_2\le\lambda_1.$
Since $\lambda_1\le\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_2\le\lambda_1,$ it follows that $\lambda_1=\lambda_2.$</p>

<p>We finish with another characterization of least upper bounds.  Note that the least upper
bound of a set might or might not be an element of that set.  For example, if
$X=\{\frac1n\,|\,n\in\N\}=\{1,\frac12,\frac13,\frac14,\dots\},$ the least upper bound is $1,$ which is in
the set.  But if $X=\{1-\frac1n\,|\,n\in\N\}=\{0,\frac12,\frac23,\frac45,\frac56,\dots\},$
then the least upper bound is again 1, but is not in the set. </p>

<div class="thm" id="lub"><p><span class="dtp">Theorem</span>:
Let $X$ be a non-empty subset of $\R$ that is bounded above, and let $\lambda$ be an upper bound
for $X.$  Then $\lambda$ is the least upper bound for $X$ if and only if for every 
$\eps>0,$ there is a $y\in X$ such that $y> \lambda-\eps.$
</p></div>
<div class="prf"><p><span class="dtp">Proof</span>: Suppose that $\lambda$ is the least upper
bound of $X.$  Let $\eps>0.$  Since $\lambda-\eps&lt;\lambda,$ and $\lambda$ is the smallest
upper bound of $X,$ it follows that $\lambda-\eps$ is not an upper bound for $X.$
This means that $X$ must contain some element $y\in X$ such that $\lambda-\eps$ is not
greater than or equal to $y.$  That is, $y>\lambda-\eps.$</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose that $\lambda$ is an upper bound for $X$ and for every $\eps>0,$ there
is a $y\in X$ such that $y\ge \lambda-\eps.$  We want to show that $\lambda$ is the least
upper bound for $X.$  Suppose that $x$ is some upper bound of $X.$  We must show that $\lambda\le x.$
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\lambda&gt;x.$  Let $\eps=\lambda-x.$
Then $\eps>0,$ and so there is a $y\in X$ such that $y>\lambda-\eps.$  Since $\lambda-\eps=x,$
this says that $y>x.$  But that contradicts the assumption that $x$ is an upper bound for $X.$
This contradiction shows that $\lambda$ must be the least upper bound.&nbsp;$\qed$
</p></div>

<p class=np>The proof might be confusing.  Some pictures can make things clearer. It's useful
to look separately at the cases where $\lambda\notin X$ and where $\lambda\in X$:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="figures/03-fig2.png" width=701 height=203></p>

<p class=np>Think of yourself standing on the number line, facing towards the positive direction.
bound of $X$ if there are no elements of $X$ in front of you.  You are at the least upper bound
if that is true, and also backing up even the tiniest distance, $\eps,$  would mean that there
is now at least one element of $X$ in front of you.  This can happen either because the point where
you are standing is itself the least upper bound of $X,$ or because there are points of $X$ that
are arbitrarily close to the point where you are standing.</p>
