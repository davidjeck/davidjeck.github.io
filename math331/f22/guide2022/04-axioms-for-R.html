<h2>04 Axioms for $\R$</h2>
<hr>

<p>We have looked at <a href="02-dedekind-cuts.html">Dedekind cuts</a> as an explicit
construction of the set of real numbers.  But how do we know that we have properly
captured all of the properties that we would expect $\R$ to have?  We need a list
of properties that express exactly what it means to be "the real numbers."
That list is given in the textbook as a set of fifteen <span class=nw>axioms</span>.
The axioms are statements about a system consisting of a set together with
operations of addition, multiplication, and comparison.  It can be shown that 
any two systems that satisfy the fifteen axioms are essentially the same;
that is, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two sets that preserves
all of the operations.  Probably the most important thing to remember from
Section 1.3 is simply what it means to have an axiomatic specification of
the real numbers.</p>

<p>Just listing the axioms does not show that there
is any system that actually satisfies them. But it can be shown that Dedekind
cuts satisfy the fifteen axioms.  So, we have come at the real numbers from
two directions: We have a set of properties that
completely characterize what we think the real numbers should be, and
we have a particular mathematical object that has all of those properties.
This allows us to say, in some sense, that we understand the real numbers
(although we don't really understand them until we understand all the
consequences of the axioms&mdash;a process that can never really be
completed but that we will make a small start in this section).</p>

<p>The first eleven axioms say that the set of real numbers, together with the
addition and multiplication operations, is a <span class=nw>field</span>.
They define the algebra of the real number system.  The requirement is that
addition and multiplication are <span class=nw>commutative</span> and 
<span class=nw>associative</span>, that <span class=nw>identities</span>
and <span class=nw>inverses</span> exist for both addition and multiplication, 
and multiplication <span class=nw>distributes</span> over addition.  There are
also <span class=nw>closure</span> axioms, which say that the sum and product
of real numbers are also real numbers. Any
system that satisfies the field axioms will automatically have many other algebraic 
properties.  That is, it will have properties that can be <b>proved</b> from
the axioms.  For example, it can be proved that identities and inverses are
unique.</p>

<p>The field axioms do not completely determine the real numbers.
There are many other fields, including $\Q,$ the set of rational numbers, and
$\C,$ the set of complex numbers.  The set $\{a+b\sqrt{2}\,|\,a,b\in\R\}$
is a field.  So is $\big\{\frac{p(\pi)}{q(\pi)}\,\big|\,p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are
polynomials with rational coefficients and $q(x)$ is not the zero polynomial$\big\}.$
For all of the these sets, the addition and multiplication operations are
the usual operations for numbers.</p>

<p>There are also finite fields.  You are probably familiar with 
$\Z_n,$ the set $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$ with the operations of addition
and multiplication $mod\;\,n.$  For a prime number $p,$ $\Z_p$ is
a field.</p>

<p>And there are algebraic systems that are not fields.  The set $\Z$ of
integers is not a field because not every integer has a multiplicative
inverse in $\Z.$  The set $\N$ of natural numbers is even further from
being a field, because it is missing both additive and multiplicative inverses.
The set $\Z_n,$ where $n$ is not prime, is not a field. (Suppose
$n$ factors as $n=ab$ where both $a$ and $b$ are strictly between
1 and $n.$  Then $b$ has no multiplicative inverse in $\Z_n.$
For if <span class=nb>$bx=1$ ($mod\;\,n$)</span>, then
<span class=nb>$0=0x=nx=abx=a1=a$ ($mod\;\,n$)</span>,
but in fact <span class=nb>$a\ne0$ ($mod\;\,n$)</span> because $a$
is strictly between 1 and $n.$)</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>$\R$ is not just a field; it is an <span class=nw>ordered field</span>.
There is an operator $&lt;$ for comparing two real numbers.  The
properties of this operation are expressed by three axioms, which 
are actually properties of the set of positive numbers:
There is a subset $P$ of $\R$ that is closed under addition and
multiplication and $\R$ is a disjoint union of $P,$ $\{0\},$
and $-P.$  Given the set $P,$ the comparison operation is defined
by saying $x&lt;y$ if and only if $y-x\in P.$  The set $P$ is
that set of <span class="nw">positive</span> elements of $\R,$
and $-P=\{-a\,|\,a\in P\},$ the set of <span class="nw">negative</span>
elements. </p>

<p>But there are other ordered fields besides $\R,$ such as the
rational numbers or indeed any field that is a proper subset of $\R.$
The final piece to completely characterize the real numbers is
<span class=nw>completeness</span>, which can be expressed by
the <a href="03-least-upper-bound-axiom.html">least upper bound axiom</a>.
This axiom means, intuitively, that there are no "holes" in the
real number line.  As we have seen, it also implies the Archimedian
property of the real numbers:  There
is no real number $x$ that is greater than every natural number.  
(Note that the field of rational numbers is Archimedian but is not 
complete, so the Archimedian property does not imply completeness.)</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>The <a href="04-axioms-for-R.html">axioms</a> for the real numbers are a foundation
that can be used to prove other properties of $\R.$  Section 1.3 includes some examples
of using the field axioms to prove things that must be true in any field.    But more
important for us is using the order axioms to define and prove things about
absolute value and distance.  Application of the completeness axiom will begin in
Section 1.4 with the <a href="05-heine-borel-theorem.html" class=nb>Heine-Borel Theorem</a>.</p>

<p>The field axioms can be used to prove things about arithmetic operations that you
probably use automatically and regard as intuitive.  The point here is that they are
not things that have to be assumed separately; once we have the field axioms, these
other "obvious" things follow logically.</p>

<p>There are several <span class=nw>uniqueness</span> results:  0 is the <b>only</b>
additive identity, 1 is the only multiplicative identity, a real number $a$ has
exactly one additive inverse, and a non-zero number $a$ has exactly one multiplicative
inverse.  This allows us to write $-a$ for <b>the</b> additive inverse of $a$ and
to define subtraction by $b-a=b+(-a).$  Similarly, we can define $a^{-1}$
for a non-zero number $a$ and division by $\frac ba = b\cdot a^{-1}.$  The existence
of inverses is what makes "cancellation" possible.  For example,</p>

<div class="thm"><p><span class="dtp">Theorem:</span> Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be 
elements of some field.  Suppose that $ab=ac$ and $a\ne 0.$  Then $b=c.$</p></div>
<div class="prf"><p><span class="dtp">Proof:</span> Since $a$ is non-zero,
it has a multiplicative inverse.  So, we have
$$\begin{array}{rll}
   ab\!\!\!\!&=ac &\mbox{(Assumption)}\\
   a^{-1}(ab)\!\!\!\!&=a^{-1}(ac)&\mbox{($a$ has multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$)} \\
   (a^{-1}a)b\!\!\!\!&=(a^{-1}a)c &\mbox{(Associativity of multiplication)}\\
   1b\!\!\!\!&=1c &\mbox{(Multiplicative inverse: $a^{-1}a=1$)}\\
   b\!\!\!\!&=c &\mbox{(1 is the multiplicative identity) }\qed\\
\end{array}$$
</p></div>

<p class=np>(The textbook justifies steps in some proofs by listing axiom numbers.
Note that you do not have to memorize the axiom numbers, but you should remember
the names of the properties.)</p>

<p>We can take most of the properties of addition, multiplication, and comparison
as being well-known, but it would still be useful to look through their proofs
in the textbook.  We should spend
a little more time on absolute value and distance.</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>The first order axiom is <span class=nw>Trichotomy</span>:
For any real number $a,$ exactly one of the following is true:
$a&lt;0,$ $a=0,$ or $a>0.$  The other two order axioms state that
for any two positive numbers $a$ and $b,$ $a+b$ and $ab$ are also
positive.  (Recall that we proved Trichotomy for $\R$ defined as the
set of Dedekind cuts.)  We can use the Trichotomy property to define
absolute value, and then use absolute value to
define distance.</p>

<div class="def"><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> For $a\in\R,$
we define the <span class=nw>absolute value</span> of $a,$
denoted $|a|,$ by 
$$|a|= \begin{cases} 
    a&\mbox{if $a>0$}\\
    0&\mbox{if $a=0$}\\
    -a&\mbox{if $a&lt;0$}
\end{cases}$$
For $a,b\in\R,$ we define the <span class=nw>distance</span> between
$a$ and $b$ to be $|a-b|.$ (Note that $|a|$ is the distance from $a$ to&nbsp;0.)
</p></div>

<p class=np>Of course, $|a|=a$ for all $a\ge0,$ but my definition makes
it clear that it is the Trichotomy axiom that is being used.  Some basic
properties can be proved easily using the axioms.</p>

<div class="thm"><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> For $a,b\in\R,$
$|ab|=|a|\cdot|b|,$ $|-a|=|a|,$ $|a-b|=|b-a|,$ and $|a-b|=0$ if and
only if $a=b.$</p></div>
<div class="prf"><p><span class=dtp>Proof:</span>
We first prove that $|ab|=|a|\cdot|b|.$
In the case $a=0$ or $b=0,$ both $|ab|$ and $|a|\cdot|b|$ are zero,
so they are equal.  In the case $a>0$ and $b>0,$ we have
$ab>0,$ so $|ab|=ab=|a|\cdot|b|,$
In the case $a&lt;0$ and $b&lt;0,$ again $ab>0,$ so
$|ab|=ab=(-a)(-b)=|a|\cdot|b|.$  In the case $a>0$ and $b&lt;0,$
$ab&lt;0,$ so $|ab|=-ab=a(-b)=|a|\cdot|b|.$  And the
case $a&lt;0$ and $b>0$ is similar.</p>
<p>It then follows that $|-a|=|-1|\cdot|a|=1\cdot|a|=|a|.$
From that, it follow that $|a-b|=|-(b-a)|=|b-a|.$
Finally, by definition of absolute value, $|a-b|=0$
if and only if $a-b=0,$ which is true if and only if $a=b.$ 
</p></div>

<p>The last part of this theorem is the important fact that the distance
between $a$ and $b$ is zero if and only if $a$ is equal to $b.$
And the next-to-last part says that distance is <span class=nw>symmetric</span>:
the distance from $a$ to $b$ is the same as the distance from $b$ to $a.$
One of the most important properties of distance is the <span class=nw>triangle
inequality</span>, which says that for any $a,b,c\in\R,$ 
$$|a-c|\le|a-b|+|b-c|$$ That is, going from $a$ to $c$ directly
cannot be longer than going from $a$ to $b$ and then from $b$ to $c.$
The triangle inequality can also be expressed as a fact about absolute
value, which is the version given in the book:
For any $a,b\in\R,$ $|a|+|b|\ge|a+b|.$  This is intuitively clear since
when $a$ and $b$ are both positive or both negative, $|a|+|b|=|a+b|,$
but when one is positive and one is negative, you get some
cancellation on the right side of the inequality but not on the
left (for example, $|3+(-5)| = |-2| = 2,$ but $|3|+|-5|=3+5=8$).
The triangle inequality for distance follows from the triangle
inequality for absolute value:  Suppose $a,b,c\in\R.$  
Let $x=a-b$ and $y=b-c.$  Then
$$\begin{align*}
   |a-b|+|b-c| &= |x|+|y|\\
               &\ge|x+y|\\
               &=|(a-b)+(b-c)|\\
               &=|a + (-b+b) - c|\\
               &=|a + 0 -c|\\
               &=|a-c|
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>The triangle inequality will be one of the most useful tools for proofs in the rest
of this course.  Some related facts about absolute value and distance will also be
useful, including Theorem 1.3.12 from the textbook:</p>

<div class="thm"><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> For any $a,b\in \R$ with $b\ge0,$
$|a|\le b$ if and only if $-b\le a\le b.$</p></div>

<p class=np>This is used in the book's proof of the triangle inequality.
I want to use it to prove two additional facts that will be useful in future
proofs.  The first fact is useful when we want to show that some
quantity, $a,$ is not too close to zero.  If we can show that $a$ is
close to some non-zero number, $m,$ then $a$ can't be too close to zero.
In particular, if $a$ is within $\frac{|m|}{2}$ of $m,$ then $a$
cannot be closer to zero than $\frac{|m|}{2}.$</p>

<div class="thm" id="less"><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> Suppose $a,m\in \R$ and
$|a-m|\le\frac{|m|}{2}.$  Then $|a|\ge\frac{|m|}{2}.$</p></div>
<div class="prf"><p><span class=dtp>Proof:</span>
Suppose that $|a-m|\le\frac{|m|}{2}.$ By the previous theorem,
$-\frac{|m|}{2}\le a-m \le \frac{|m|}{2}.$</p>
<p>Consider the case $m\ge0,$ so that $|m|=m.$  Then the first inequality,
$-\frac{|m|}{2}\le a-m,$ becomes $-\frac{m}{2}\le a-m$ and adding $m$
to both sides gives $\frac{m}{2}\le a.$ That is, $a\ge\frac{m}{2}=\frac{|m|}{2}.$  And
because $\frac{m}{2}\ge0,$ we also have $a\ge0,$ so $a=|a|.$  So we
get $|a|\ge\frac{|m|}{2}.$</p>
<p>Turing to the case $|m|&lt;0,$ we have $|m|=-m$ and the inequality
$a-m \le \frac{|m|}{2}$ becomes $a-m\le -\frac{m}{2}.$ Adding $m$ to
both sides gives $a\le\frac{m}{2}.$  Multiplying by $-1$ then gives
$-a\ge=-\frac{m}{2}.$  Since $\frac{m}{2}&lt;0,$ we
see that $a$ is also negative, so the inequality $-a\ge=-\frac{m}{2}$
can be written $|a|\ge\frac{|m|}{2}.$ $\qed$

<p class=np>If the proof is confusing, this diagram shows that the geometry is clear:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="figures/04-fig1.png" width=358 height=248></p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to <span class=nw>bound</span> $a.$  That is, we want to find
some limit on how big $|a|$ can be.  If we can show that $a$ is close to some
number $m,$ then we can show that $|a|$ cannot be too much bigger than $|m|.$

<div class="thm" id="bound"><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> Suppose $a,m\in \R$ and
$\eps>0.$  If $|a-m|\le\eps,$ then $|a|\le|m|+\eps.$</p></div>
<div class="prf"><p><span class=dtp>Proof:</span>
Suppose that $|a-m|\le\eps.$  Then $-\eps\le a-m\le \eps.$  Adding
$m$ gives $m-\eps\le a\le m+\eps.$</p>
<p>Consider the case where $m\ge0.$ Then the inequality $a\le m+\eps$
becomes $a\le |m|+\eps.$  [If $\eps$ is small compared to $m,$ then $a$
will have the same sign as $m,$ so in this case, $a$ would be positive,
and $a=|a|.$  This means we already have $|a|\le |m|+\eps;$ however, to
cover all possibilities, we need to consider the general case where $a$
can be negative.]
Now, for any $m,$  $-|m|\le m,$ and so from
the inequality $m-\eps\le a,$ we get $-(|m|+\eps)=-|m|-\eps\le m-\eps\le a.$
Combining that with the previous inequality, we have $-(|m|+\eps)\le a\le (|m|+\eps),$ which is equivalent to
$|a|\le|m|+\eps.$</p>
<p>Turning to the case $m&lt;0,$ from $|m-a|&lt;\eps,$ we get $|(-m)-(-a)|=|-(m-a)|=|m-a|&lt;\eps.$
Since $-m&gt;0,$ we can apply the previous case to $|(-m)-(-a)|&lt;\eps,$
showing that $|-a|&le;|-m|+\eps.$  But $|-a|=|a|$
and $|-m|=|m|,$ so we have in fact $|a|&lt;|m|+\eps.$ $\qed$
</p></div>

<p class=np>And here is a diagram showing the geometry, in the case where $\eps$
is small compared to $|m|:$</p>
