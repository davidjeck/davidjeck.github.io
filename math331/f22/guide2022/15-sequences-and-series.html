<h2>16 Sequences and Series of Real Numbers</h2>
<hr>

<p>We have already looked at <a href="10-limits-and-continuity-in-metric-spaces.html">limits of
sequences</a> in a metric space, as a generalization of the limit of a sequence in $\R$.
Chapter&nbsp;4 in the textbook takes a more in-depth look at sequences in $\R$, and it 
covers series (infinite sums) in detail.  Some of the material will be familiar from
Calculus II, but there are many new ideas.</p>

<p>We consider sequences of real numbers.  To review: Remember that a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ 
is really a function from $\N$ to $\R$.  We say that $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=L$
if for every $\eps>0$, there is an $N\in\N$ such that $|x_n-L|<\eps$ for all $n\ge N$.
If a sequence has a limit, we say that the sequence <span class=nw>converges</span>; a seqence
that does not converge is said to <span class=nw>diverge</span>.  A special case of divergence is
divergence to $\pm\infty$.  We say $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=+\infty$ if for every $M\in\R$,
there is an $N\in\N$ such that $x_n>M$ for all $n\ge N$.  We say $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=-\infty$ 
if for every $M\in\R$, there is an $N\in\N$ such that $x_n&lt;M$ for all $n\ge N$.  It is important
to remember that when $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=+\infty$ or $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=-\infty$,
the sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is divergent.</p>

<p>The new material on sequences of real numbers is mainly concerned with two important
classes of sequences:  monotone sequences and Cauchy sequences.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> A sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is
<span class=nw>increasing</span> if for all $n,m\in\N$, if $n>m$ then $x_n\ge x_m$.
It is <span class=nw>decreasing</span> if for all $n,m\in\N$, if $n>m$ then $x_n\le x_m$.
And is is <span class=nw>monotone</span> if it is either increasing or decreasing.
(Note that "increasing" in this definition should probably be called non-decreasing,
and "decreasing" should be non-increasing.)
</p></div>

<p>It should be clear that an increasing sequence that is bounded above is convergent.
In fact, it converges to $lub\{x_n\,|\,n\in\N\}$.  Similarly, a decreasing
sequence that is bounded below converges to its greatest lower bound.
These facts are stated in this theorem:</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Monotone Convergence Theorem:</span>
An increasing sequence that is bounded above is convergent.  An increasing sequence
that is not bounded above diverges to infinity. A decreasing
sequence that is bounded below is convergent.  A decreasing sequence that
is not bounded below diverges to minus infinity.</p></div>

<p>A Cauchy sequence is one in which the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily
close to each other as $n\to\infty$,   The major result is that any Cauchy
sequence of real numbers is convergent.  Note that both this fact and the 
Monotone Convergence Theorem depend on the completeness of $\R$ in an
essential way.  For example, it is not true that a Cauchy sequence of
rational numbers must converge to a rational number.  We also consider
a particular type of sequence called a "contraction."
</p>

<div class=def><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> A sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is
said to be a <span class=nw>Cauchy sequence</span> if for any $\eps>0$, there is
an $N\in\N$ such that for any $n\ge N$ and $m\ge N$, $|x_n-x_m|<\eps$.</div>

<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Cauchy Convergence Theorem:</span>
Any Cauchy sequence of real numbers is convergent.</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class="dtp">Theorem (The Contraction Principle):</span>
Let $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of real numbers.  Suppose that there
is a real number $r$ in the range $0&lt;r&lt;1$ such that for all $n$,
$|a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}|\le|a_{n+1}-a_n|$.  Then the sequence is convergent.</p></div>

<p>Note by the way that all of these convergence criteria will apply to a
sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ that "eventually" meets the criteria, that is if 
there is an $K\in\N$ such that the criterion holds for the subsequence
$\{x_n\}_{n=K}^\infty$.  This is because $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ and
$\{x_n\}_{n=K}^\infty$ clearly have the same convergence behavior (since
convergence is about what happens to $x_n$ in the long run, which doesn't
depend on the first $K$ terms of the sequence). 
For example, a bounded-above sequence will converge by the Monotone
Convergence Sequence if it is consistently increasing after the 
$K^{\rm th}$ term, no matter what it does for the first $K$ terms.</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>Closely related to infinite sequences are <span class=nw>infinite series</span>.
An infinite series is written as an infinite sum such as $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$.
To make sense of such a sum, we have to look at the infinite sequence of partial
sums of the series.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span> The <span class=nw>k-th partial
sum</span> of the infinite series $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is the value of the
finite sum $\ds\sum_{n=1}^ka_n$.  The infinite series is <span class=nw>convergent</span>
if the sequence of partial sums, $\ds\Big\{\sum_{n=1}^ka_n\Big\}_{k=1}^\infty$, is convergent;
otherwise the series is <span class=nw>divergent</span>.  For a convergent series,
the <span class=nw>sum</span> of the series is defined to be the limit of the
sequence of partial sums, and we write $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n=\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^ka_n$.
Similarly, we write $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = \pm\infty$ when
$\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^ka_n=\pm\infty$.</p></div>

<p>Much of the theory of infinite sequences carries over to infinite series.  For example,
suppose that $a_n\ge 0$ for all $n$.  In that case, the sequence of partial sums is
increasing, so the Monotone Convergence Theorem applies to the sequence of partial
sums.  This means that the series will either converge or will diverge to infinity,
depending on whether or not the sequence of partial sums is bounded above.
This fact is one of the reasons that we often consider series of non-negative
terms.  A <span class=nw>non-negative series</span>
is one whose terms are all greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p>Major results about series include a variety of tests for convergence and divergence.
Note that many of these tests apply only to non-negative series.  However, the
$n^{\rm th}$ term test applies to any series.  It says that a series cannot converge
unless its terms get small.  It is usually used as a test for divergence.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (The $n^{\rm th}$ term test)</span>
If the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges, then $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0$.
Equivalently if $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n$ does not exist, or if the limit is some
non-zero value, then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty$ diverges.</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Comparison test)</span>
Suppose that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ are
non-negative series.</p>
<p>If $a_n\le b_n$ for all $n$ and if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$
converges, then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ also converges.</p>
<p>If $a_n\ge b_n$ for all $n$ and if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$
diverges, then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ also diverges.
</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Ratio test)</span>
Suppose that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is a non-negative series, and that
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=L$ (where $L$ can be either
a non-negative number or $+\infty$).  If $0\le L&lt;1$, then
the series converges.  If $L&gt;1$, then the series diverges.
(If $L=1$, then the test gives no information about convergence of the series.)
</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Root test)</span>
Suppose that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is a non-negative series, and that
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\root n \of {a_n}=L$ (where $L$ can be either
a non-negative number or $+\infty$).  If $0\le L&lt;1$, then
the series converges.  If $L&gt;1$, then the series diverges.
(If $L=1$, then the test gives no information about convergence of the series.)
</p></div>

<p>Infinite series also have a linearity property, similar to the linearity 
property of the definite integral:</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span>
If $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ are convergent series,
then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n+b_n)$ also converges, and
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n+b_n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$$
If $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is a convergent series and $r\in\R$ then
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty ra_n$ also converges, and
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty ra_n = r\cdot \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$$
</p></div>

<hr class=break>

<p>For series that can have both positive and negative terms, we can distinguish between
"absolute" convergence and "conditional" convergence.  It can be shown that a series that
is absolutely convergent is also convergent.  And we get one more test for 
convergence that applies to alternating series, in which the terms alternate
between positive and negative.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class="dtp">Definition:</span>
Let $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ be a series.  The series is said to be
<span class=nw>absolutely convergent</span> if the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|$
is convergent.  A series that is convergent but not absolutely convergent
is said to be <span class=nw>conditionally convergent</span>.
That is, $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is conditionally convergent if
it converges but $\sum_{n=1}^\infty|a_n|$ diverges.</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem:</span> If the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$
converges absolutely, then it converges.</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Alternating Series Test)</span>
Let $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a decreasing sequence of non-negative terms,
such that $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=0$.  Then the series
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^na_n$ converges.
</p></div>

<p>The most typical example of a conditionally convergent series is
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$.  This series converges by the
Alternating Series Test, but the series of absolute values is the
well-known <span class=nw>harmonic series</span>, 
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac1n$, which diverges.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the Ratio and Root tests can be adapted for
series that can include negative as well as non-negative terms, using absolute
convergence:</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Ratio test)</span>
Let $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ be any series, and suppose that
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|}=L$ (where $L$ can be either
a non-negative number or $+\infty$.)  If $0\le L&lt;1$, then
the series converges absolutely.  If $L&gt;1$, then the series diverges.
(If $L=1$, then the test gives no information about convergence of the series.)
</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem (Root test)</span>
Let $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ be any series, and suppose that
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\root n \of {|a_n|}=L$ (where $L$ can be either
a non-negative number or $+\infty$.)  If $0\le L&lt;1$, then
the series converges absolutely.  If $L&gt;1$, then the series diverges.
(If $L=1$, then the test gives no information about convergence of the series.)
