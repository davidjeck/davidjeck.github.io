<h2>12 The Derivative</h2>
<hr>

<p>Of course, one of the main reasons for looking at limits in calculus is to
use them to define the derivative of a function.  The derivative is covered
in sections 3.1 through 3.3 of the textbook.  There is little here, really,
that was not already covered in calculus, except that the level of rigor
is higher.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span>
Let $f$ be a real-valued function of a real variable, and let $a\in \R$.  Assume
that $f$ is defined on some open interval containing $a$.  Then the <span class=nw>derivative
of $f$ at $a$</span> is defined to be $$f'(a)=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$
provided the limit exists.  If the limit exists, then $f$ is said to be 
<span class=nw>differentiable</span> at $a$.  The function $f'$ is called the
<span class=nw>derivative</span> of $f$, and its domain is the set of all points
in the domain of $f$ at which $f$ is differentiable.</p></div>

<p>It is then possible to prove that if $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then
$f$ must be continuous at $a$.  It is also possible to prove the usual differentiation
rules for sums, differences, products, and quotients, as well as the chain rule
for the derivative of a composition $f\circ g$.</p>

<p>The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) is a geometrically obvious fact that turns out
to be important in the proofs of a number of future calculus theorems, such
as L'H&ocirc;pital's rule.  There is also a Generalized Mean Value Theorem that applies 
to two functions.</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem</span> (Mean Value Theorem):
Suppose the function $f$ is continuous on the closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ and is differentiable
on $(a,b)$.  Then there is a $c\in(a,b)$ such that $$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$</p></div>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Theorem</span> (Generalized Mean Value Theorem):
Suppose the functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous on the closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ and are differentiable
on $(a,b)$.  Then there is a $c\in(a,b)$ such that $$(g(b)-g(a))f'(c)=(f(b)-f(a))g'(c)$$</p></div>

<p class=np>It is the Generalized Mean Value Theorem that is used to prove L'H&ocirc;pital's rule.  Note
that if it happens that $g'(c)\ne 0$ and $g(b)\ne g(a)$, then the conclusion can be written
$$\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}$$ In particular, applying the generalized theorem
to the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)=x$ yields the basic Mean Value Theorem for $f(x)$.</p>
