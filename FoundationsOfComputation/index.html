<p><i><a href="FoundationsOfComputation_2.3.2_6x9.pdf"><big>F</big>oundations of Computation</a></i> is a <b>free</b> textbook for a one-semester
course in theoretical computer science.  It has been used for several years
in a course at Hobart and William Smith Colleges.  The course has no
prerequisites other than introductory computer programming.  The first half
of the course covers material on logic, sets, and functions that would often 
be taught in a course in discrete mathematics.  The second part covers
material on automata, formal languages, and grammar that would ordinarily
be encountered in an upper level course in theoretical computer science.
</p>
<p>Version 2.3 (Summer 2010) added a section on pushdown automata;
aside from that, there were only minor corrections and changes.
The most recent version, 2.3.1 (Summer 2011), is a very minor update,
with one new proof and a few corrections.  In December 2016, the license under
which the book is released was changed; the version number was changed to 2.3.2,
but 2.3.2 is identical to 2.3.1 except for the new license.  In June 2020, new versions 
of the PDF files were posted, with internal links, and a link was added to the
version at LibreTexts.

<p>(The image on the left is the cover of the print version of the book.
The background image is a visualization of a small piece of the famous
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/js/mandelbrot/MB.html">Mandelbrot&nbsp;set</a>, 
which has nothing to do with the content of the book &mdash;
except for the fact that the Mandelbrot set is an example of a complicated
and beautiful structure produced by very simple computational means. The
region of the xy-plane that is shown on the cover is approximately
0.35471950 &lt; x &lt; 0.35473217 and
