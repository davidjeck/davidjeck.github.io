<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 4: First Work in 3D</h2>

<div class="intro">


<p>This is our first lab on 3D graphics.  You will be working with OpenGL 1.1,
drawing and transforming simple shapes.  You can work either in Java or in JavaScript.</p>

<p>If you use JavaScript, you will need copies of the  three files in
<span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs424/lab4-files-js</span>.
Or you can get the files here:
<a href="lab4-files-js/First3D.html" style="white-space:pre">First3D.html</a>,
<a href="lab4-files-js/glsim.js" style="white-space:pre">glsim.js</a>,
and <a href="lab4-files-js/basic-object-models-IFS.js" style="white-space:pre">basic-object-models-IFS.js</a>.
You will only make changes to First3D.html, but that program depends on the two JavaScript files.
No special setup is needed for the JavaScript version.</p>

<p>If you use Java, you will need copies of the two files in
<span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs424/lab4-files-jogl</span>.
Or you can get the files here:
<a href="lab4-files-jogl/First3D.java" style="white-space:pre">First3D.java</a>
and <a href="lab4-files-jogl/Camera.java" style="white-space:pre">Camera.java</a>.
You will only make changes to First3D.java, but that program depends on Camera.java.</p>

<p><b>To program in Java, you will need to use the JOGL API</b>, an implementation of
OpenGL for Java. See <a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c3/s6.html#gl1geom.6.2">Subsection&nbsp;3.6.2</a>
for instructions on doing that in Eclipse.  The basic idea is to make a "User Library" containing
the JOGL two .jar files, <span style="white-space:pre">jogl-all.jar</span> and <span style="white-space:pre">gluegen-rt.jar</span>.  
Then you can start a new project and add the JOGL user library to the
project.  There are copies of the JOGL .jar files and the native libraries for Linux
in <i style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs424/JOGL</i>.  (<b>Note:</b> There is
no need to make copies of these files, if you are using them on Linux.  Your User Library
can can refer directly to the copies in <i style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs424/JOGL</i>.)
You can also get copies of the .jar files and the native libraries for 
Linux, Windows, or Mac from 
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/eck/cs424/jogl_2_4_support/" style="white-space:pre">https://math.hws.edu/eck/cs424/jogl_2_4_support/</a>.
Be sure to read all the instructions in the textbook and follow them carefully!
Note that it is also possible to compile and run JOGL programs on the command line by adding
appropriate options to the javac and java commands.</p>

<p><b>Turning in your work:</b>
Your completed program should be submitted by the beginning of the lab period next Thursday.
You can turn in a folder containing all of the required files, or you can just submit the
file that you worked on, First3D.java or First3D.html.</p>

<h3>The Assignment</h3>

<p>When the program for this lab is complete, it will be able to draw six 3D objects (although
one of the objects is a flat 2D object that lies in a plane).  You just need to complete
the <i>draw</i>() subroutine, which is called whenever the scene needs to be redrawn.
The <i>draw</i>() subroutine will draw just one of the objects; which one it draws will
depend on the value of the global integer variable <i>objectNumber</i>, which can 
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or&nbsp;6. The six objects that you have to draw are described below.</p>

<p>You only need to work in the section of the program that is labeled
"TODO: Complete this section!".  You don't need to understand the rest of the program.</p>

<p>The program contains empty subroutines named <i>bar</i>(), <i>square</i>(), and <i>cage</i>()
for drawing three of the objects.  This is hierarchical modeling:  <i>bar</i>() will be used
to write <i>square</i>(), and <i>square</i>() will be used to write <i>cage</i>().  You can
write subroutines for the other three objects, if you want to, but that is not required.</p>

<p>The user will select the object to be drawn by pressing the number keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
on the keyboard.  The user can rotate the scene by dragging on it with the mouse.
Pressing the Return or Home will restore the original point of view.  You don't have to
implement any of that.  It's already done by the program.</p>

<p>We have not yet covered a lot of things that are necessary for
realistic-looking 3D scenes.  To avoid disappointing you with the look of the scenes
in this lab, the starter files do some setup in their initialization subroutines
that you are not expected to understand.  In particular, they set up a
perspective projection and turn on some basic lighting effects.  And they
turn on the option <code>GL_COLOR_MATERIAL</code>, which makes the colors 
set by <i>glColor*</i> functions act like correctly lit material so that the
objects are shaded correctly.</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>OpenGL and GLUT Functions</h3>

<p>You will use the OpenGL <i>glColor*</i> functions for setting the color of objects.
You will need the transformation functions <i>glRotated</i>, <i>glScaled</i>, and <i>glTranslated</i>
for applying transformations, and <i>glPushMatrix</i> and <i>glPopMatrix</i> for saving and
restoring the current transformation.</p>

<p>(Note that for JOGL, all the OpenGL functions are implemented as methods in a graphics context object, 
which is named <i>gl2</i> in the program.  That is, all the names must be preceded by
"gl2.".  For example, <code>gl2.glColor3d(1,0,1)</code>. Furthermore OpenGL constants are defined in the
class <i>GL2</i>, so they have names like <code>GL2.GL_TRIANGLES</code>.

<p>For two of the objects, you will use <i>glBegin</i>, <i>glEnd</i>, and <i>glVertex*</i>.
The other four objects will be constructed out of basic shapes using transformations.
To draw the basic shapes, you will use three functions from the GLUT library:
<i>glutSolidShpere</i>(), <i>glutSolidCylinder</i>(), and<i>glutSolidCone</i>(). (For JavaScript,
you will actually be using simulated GLUT functions, defined in the program).
These GLUT functions are discussed below, when they are needed.
</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>Object Number 1: A 2D Shape</h3>

<p>Object number 1 is a simple 2D shape, which you should draw directly, using <i>glBegin</i>(),
<i>glEnd</i>(), <i>glVertex*</i>(), and <i>glColor*</i>.  <b>Use different colors
for different vertices.</b>  Here is the shape, with the vertices labeled:</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="shape.png" width="185" height="161" style="border:none"></p>

<p class="np">It is possible to make this shape using <b>a single primitive</b> of type either GL_TRIANGLE_FAN or GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">
<h3>Object Number 2: Wireframe Polyhedron</h3>

<p>This exercise is as much about understanding arrays as it is about OpenGL drawing.  You might want
to leave it for later so that during the lab you can concentrate on using 3D transformations for the next four objects.</p>

<p>Object number 2 is a wireframe polyhedron.  That is, you will just draw the <b>edges</b> of the
polyhedron.  The particular polyhedron is called a <i>stellated dodecahedron</i>.  It has 60
triangular faces.  The data for the polyhedron is already in the program, in two large two-dimensional arrays named
<i>dodecVertices</i> and <i>dodecTriangles</i>.  You should find those arrays and take a look at them!</p>

<p>The first array, <i>dodecVertices</i>,
contains the (x,y,z) coordinates of the vertices of the polyhedron.
For example, vertex number 13 has coordinates</p>

<pre>
         (<i>dodecVertices</i>[13][0], <i>dodecVertices</i>[13][1],  <i>dodecVertices</i>[13][2])
</pre>

<p class=np>You can use these coordinates in the function <i>glVertex3d</i>(x,y,z), or you can
use the entire array in <i>glVertex3dv</i>(array).  (In Java, remember, the functions
are <i>gl2.glVertex3d</i>(x,y,z) and <i>gl2.glVertex3dv</i>(array,0).)</p>

<p>The second array, <i>dodecTriangles</i>, is a 2D array of integers.  Each row of the array contains
three integers, giving the vertex numbers for the vertices of one of the triangular faces of the polyhedron.
That is, the integers in <i>dodecTriangles</i> are indices into the vertex array.  For example,
The three vertices of face number 7 have vertex numbers <i>dodecTriangles</i>[7][0], <i>dodecTriangles</i>[7][1],
and <i>dodecTriangles</i>[7][2].  These vertex numbers are row numbers in the <i>dodecVertices</i> array. 
</p>

<p>Your job is to draw the outline of each of the 60 triangular faces.  You can do that by drawing 
each face separately as a primitive of type <i>GL_LINE_LOOP</i>.  
Using the two arrays can easily get confusing.  When processing face
number <i>i</i>, I suggest that you give names to the vertex numbers for that face.  For example,</p>

<pre class="code">
int b = dodecTriangles[i][1];  // Index in dodecVertices for vertex 1 of face i.
</pre>

<p class="np">(If you still find this confusing, you can look ahead at the discussion of
"Indexed Face Sets" in
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c3/s4.html#gl1geom.4.1">Subsection&nbsp;3.4.1</a>.
But remember that here you are drawing the edges, not the faces, of the polyhedron.)</p>

<p><b>Important Note:</b> A wireframe should be drawn with lighting effects turned off!  To implement that,
you should use the command</p>

<pre class="code">
glDisable(GL_LIGHTING);  // or gl2.glDisable(GL2.GL_LIGHTING) in Java
</pre>

<p class="np">before you draw the polyhedron, and</p>

<pre class="code">
glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);  // or gl2.glEnable(GL2.GL_LIGHTING) in Java
</pre>

<p class="np">after you draw the polyhedron.</p>

<p>(One more note:  The initialization subroutine calls <i>glLineWidth</i>(3), to make lines 3 pixels
wide.  The stellated dodecahedron is the only shape that uses lines, so this setting only applies
to that shape.  The wider lines make the shape more distinct.)</p>

<h3>Object Number 3: A Simple Tree</h3>

<p>Object number 3 is a very simple example of using GLUT and transforms.  This is just
a warm-up for the remaining objects.  The third
object is a solid, 3D object that consists of a green cone sitting on top
of a brown cylinder, meant to look a little like a tree.  Here are two pictures of the
tree in slightly different orientations so that you can see that cone actually has
no bottom (which is unfortunate, but we will put up with it):</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="trees.png" width="476" height="399"></p>

<p class="np">The cone and the cylinder can be drawn using the GLUT library:</p>

<pre class="code">glutSolidCylinder( radius, height, 32, 8 );

glutSolidCone( radius, height, 32, 8 );
</pre>

<p class="np">In Java, the method names will be <i>glut.glutSolidCylinder</i>
and <i>glut.glutSolidCone</i>.  The first two parameters specify the size of the
object.  The last two are "slices" and "stacks" and determine how smooth the
curved surfaces will be; the values 32 and 8 are fine for this lab.</p>

<p>For this example, my cone has radius 3.5 and height 8, my cylinder has
radius 1.5 and height 5, and the cylinder sticks 1 unit into the
interior of the cone.</p>

<p>If no transformation is applied, both the cone and the cylinder are drawn with the center of their bases
at (0,0,0) and with their axes lying along the positive z-axis (that is,
pointing directly out of the screen).  So, if you just use the above commands, the cone and cylinder will be in the same location!
Obviously, you will need to apply a transformation.  In the end, the complete
object should have its center approximately at (0,0,0) for proper display.  It will still
be pointing directly at you, so you will have to apply a transformation to rotate it into
a vertical orientation on the screen.</p>

<p>Don't forget to use <i>glPushMatrix</i>() and <i>glPopMatrix</i>(), as necessary, to
limit the effect of the transformations that you apply!</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Objects Number 4, 5, and 6: Build a Cage</h3>

<p>Objects number 4, 5, and 6 are stages in building a "cage" out of cylinders and
spheres.  The cage, object number 6, has eight spheres at the vertices of a cube.  The centers are
the points (-4,-4,-4), (-4,-4,4), (-4,4,-4), etc.  There is a narrow cylinder
lying along each edge of the cube.  You should use a different color for the cylinders than you use for
for the spheres.  Note that a sphere can be drawn using the GLUT function</p>

<pre class="code">
glutSolidSphere( radius, 32, 32 );
</pre>

<p class="np">or <i>glut.glutSolidShpere</i> for Java.  The center of the sphere is
at (0,0,0).  The first parameter is the radius.  The other two parameters are, again,
"slices" and "stacks"; you can use the value 32 for this lab.</p>

<p>Object number 4 is a "bar" consisting of a cylinder with a sphere at each end.
<b>The cylinder lies along the x-axis</b>, and the centers of the spheres are at (-4,0,0) and (4,0,0):</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="bar.png" width="254" height="54"></p>

<p class="np">You should complete the <i>bar</i>() subroutine to draw this object.  Note that for Java,
the graphics context, <i>gl2</i>, is a parameter to the subroutine.</p>

<p>Object number 5 is square shape that can be made out of two translated copies of the bar,
plus two additional cylinders.  <b>The square lies in the xy-plane</b>, and the centers
of the four spheres are at (-4,4,0), (4,4,0), (-4,-4,0), and (4,-4,0).  (Do not make
the square out of four bars &mdash; that would actually contain eight spheres, not four.)
This is to be drawn by the <i>square</i>() subroutine:</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="square.png" width="248" height="249"></p>

<p>Finally, object number 6 is the full cage, which can be made from two translated copies of
the square, plus four additional cylinders.  It should be centered at (0,0,0):</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="cage.png" width="358" height="365"></p>

</div>


<hr>

<div class="section">

<p>Here, by the way is what happens to the cage when lighting is turned off, and the colors
are treated as simple color rather than material  Simple color looks completely flat.  There
is none of the shading that comes from the interaction of light with material.  The picture
barely looks 3D at all.  Your brain might still try to interpret it as 3D because the smaller
size of some spheres makes them look farther away and because similar line drawings are
often used to represent cubes,</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="cage-unlit.png" width="359" height="365"></p>
