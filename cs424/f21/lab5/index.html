<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 5: Data for glDrawArrays</h2>

<div class="intro">


<p>Last week, you worked with an IFS representation of a polyhedron, and used it
to draw a wireframe model with the functions glBegin(), glVertex(), and so on.  But those
functions are not available in modern OpenGL.  Instead, glDrawArrays() and glDrawElements()
are used for drawing.  The function glDrawElements() is actually not suitable for drawing
flat shaded polyhedra.  (It's good for smooth shaded polyhedra that are trying to look like
a curved surface.)  So in this lab, you will draw polyhedra using glDrawArrays().  Hopefully,
this will help you understand this function.</p>

<p>You will need the three files in /classes/cs424/lab5-files, or you can get them
through these links:&nbsp;
<a href="lab5-files/Polyhedra.html">Polyhedra.html</a>,&nbsp;
<a href="lab5-files/glsim.js">glsim.js</a>,&nbsp; and&nbsp;
<a href="lab5-files/polyhedra.js">polyhedra.js</a>.
You will only work on Polyhedra.html.</p>


<p><b>Turning in your work:</b>
Your completed program should be submitted by the beginning of the lab period next Thursday.
You can turn in a folder containing all of the required files, or you can just submit the
file that you worked on, Polyhedra.html.</p>

<h3>The Assignment</h3>

<p>The assignment is mostly about drawing polyhedra using <i>glDrawArrays</i>(), but as a
warm-up, you will draw a "point cloud," a large number of randomly selected points inside a sphere.</p>


<p>You should edit the file <a href="lab5-files/Polyhedra.html">Polyhedra.html</a>.
You will only need to fill in the bodies of the <i>drawPointCloud</i>() function and of the
<i>drawPolyhedron</i>() function &mdash; and 
hopefully write some other functions to help you will the polyhedra.  There is a long
comment on <i>drawPolyhedron</i>(), and the nasty code that is needed for using
<i>glDrawArrays</i>() is there in a comment inside the function.  We looked 
at that code in class on Wednesday.</p>

<p>For a point cloud, you need to generate a large number of points inside a sphere of radius 8.
To pick points, you can just choose random values for <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>
using the formula <code style="white-space:pre">16*Math.random() - 8</code>.
This gives a point in a cube.  You can test whether the point is inside the sphere by testing
if <code style="white-space:pre">x**2 + y**2 + z**2 < 64</code>.  If not, you should discard the
point; only keep points that are inside the sphere.  The coordinates for the points have to stored
in a <i>Float32Array</i>, which is meant to be the global variable named <i>pointCloud</i> in the
program.  You should create that array <b>only once</b>, the first time <i>drawPointCloud</i>() is
called. Note that you can check whether the array already exists using the test
<code style="white-space:pre">if (pointCloud)</code>.
Once you have that array, you can draw the sphere using a call to
<i>glDrawArray</i>() with primitive type <code>GL_POINTS</code>.  See the <i>drawPointcloud</i>()
function for details.  Here is a point cloud with 10,000 points.  It looks interesting when
you rotate it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center" class=np><img src="pointcloud.png" width=369 height=369></p>

<p>The JavaScript file <i>polyhedra.js</i> defines several polyhedra as indexed face sets.
Each polyhedron is a JavaScript object.  If <i>poly</i> is one of those objects, then
it has three properties: <i>poly.vertices</i>, <i>poly.faces</i>, and <i>poly.faceNormals</i>.
Each of these is an array of arrays (that is, a two-dimensional array).  See the
on function <i>drawPolyhedron</i>() in file Polyhedra.html for more information.</p>

<p>For use with <i>glDrawArrays</i>(), the data for the polyhedron must be stored in
one-dimensional arrays of numbers.  The arrays that you need can be constructed using
the data from <i>poly.vertices</i>, <i>poly.faces</i>, and <i>poly.faceNormals</i>.
That is your job for this lab.</p>

<p>Rather than rebuild the arrays every time a polyhedron needs to be drawn, 
you should compute them once and save them.  JavaScript has the nice property that
you can add things to an object that already exists.  It makes sense to stash the
arrays that you need for <i>glDrawArrays</i>() in the same object that already
represents the polyhedron.  The arrays that you need to create will be
<i>poly.lineCoords</i>, <i>poly.faceCoords</i>, and <i>poly.normalCoords</i>().
(You can create the array the first time you need it, and add it to the object
for later reuse.  Note that you can test whether <i>poly.lineCoords</i> already
exists by testing <code>if&nbsp;(&nbsp;!&nbsp;poly.lineCoords&nbsp;)</code>.</p>

<p>So, what has to go into these new arrays?  I suggest that you start with
<i>poly.lineCoords</i> and get the wireframe working first.</p>

<p>The wireframe polyhedron is drawn using <i>poly.lineCoords</i> and <i>GL_LINES</i>
with <i>glDrawArrays</i>().
For <i>GL_LINES</i>, you need two vertices in the array for each line segment that is to be drawn.
Each vertex requires three coordinates, so that's six numbers per line segment.
Every side of every face in the polyhedron has to be drawn.  You need to collect
all of the coordinates for all of the line segments into an array.  In JavaScript,
a nice way to do that is to start with an empty array and use the array's <i>push</i>()
function to add elements to it.  If you have collected all the coordinates into
a JavaScript array named <i>coords</i>, then you should set</p>

<pre class=code>poly.linecCoords = new Float32Array(coords);</pre>

<p class=np>The above line creates a <i>Float32Array</i> containing the
same data as <i>coords</i>.</p>

<p>When you are making the coordinate array, remember that the numbers in one of
the face arrays from <i>poly.faces</i> are indices into the array of vertices, <i>poly.vertices</i>.
You need to get the coordinates out of the vertex array.  Note that edges of a face connect
vertex number <i>j</i> to vertex number <i>j+1</i> of that face, except for the last edge,
which connects back to vertex number zero.  As usual, it will be less confusing if you give
names to the two vertex indices for an edge.</p>

<hr width="40%" align=center>

<p>For drawing the faces of the polyhedron using <i>GL_TRIANGLES</i>, you need 
an array of vertex coordinates for the faces (<i>poly.faceCoords</i>) and an array of 
normal vector coordinates (<i>poly.normalCoords</i>).
The array of vertex coordinates contains three vertices &mdash;
that is, nine numbers &mdash; for every triangular face. The array <i>poly.normalCoords</i>
must contain a separate normal vector (three numbers) for every vertex in <i>poly.faceCoords</i>.
This is true even though all the vertices of a face have the same normal vector.  There is
a lot of redundancy here: You will add multiple copies of the same normal vector
to <i>poly.normalCoords</i>.</p>

<p>You have another problem.  The faces that you draw using the <i>GL_TRIANGLES</i>
primitive must be triangles.  But some faces of the polyhedra have four, five, or six
sides.  You have to subdivide those faces into triangles and treat each triangle
separately:</p>

<p class=np align=center><img src="triangles.png" width="423" height="130">

<p class=np>Note that the vertices of the triangles are vertex zero, vertex <i>j</i>
and vertex <i>j+1</i>, for all values of <i>j</i> from 1 to one less than the maximum
vertex number.  For example, the three vertices in the five-sided polygon have
vertices number 0, 1, and 2 for the first triangle; 0, 2, and 3 for the second triangle;
and 0, 3, and 4 for the third triangle.
</p>

<hr width="40%" align=center>

<p>You will need to apply a scale to the polyhedra to get them to a reasonable size.  
Unfortunately, they are not all scaled to the same initial size.  Using <i>glScale3f(3,3,3)</i>
doesn't give bad results.  But it would be nicer to compute the correct scale for each polyhedron.
To do that, you can find the maximum length of all the vertices in the polyhedron.
Then a nice value for the scale factor is <i style=white-space:pre>8/maxLength</i>.
The length of a vertex with coordinates (<i>x,y,z</i>) is
<i style="white-space:pre">Math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)</i>.  ("Length" here really means
the distance of the vertex from (0,0,0).)</p>

<hr width="40%" align=center>

<p>You might want to try assigning random colors to the faces of the polyhedra.  If you
want to do that, you would need a color array, and you would have to use
<i>glEnableClientState</i>(<i>GL_COLOR_ARRAY</i>) to activate it...</p>

<hr>

<p style=np>Here are two stellated dodecahedrons, showing both the faces and the wireframe,
one using random face colors (with random color components computed as 0.5+0.5*Math.random()).</p>.
