<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 13: gl-matrix</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>This is, I hope, a genuinely short lab that you should be able to complete
in the lab period.</p>

<p>You will need a copy of <a href="lab13-files/" class=nb>/classes/cs424/lab13-files</a>,
or at least copies of the four files that it contains.  The folder includes a copy of
the JavaScript library  <a href="lab13-files/gl-matrix.js" class=nb>gl-matrix.js</a>,
which we have discussed in class.  In this lab, you will use that library to manipulate
a modelview matrix.  There is also a copy of
<a href="lab13-filesbasic-object-models-IFS.js" class=nb>basic-object-models-IFS.js</a>,
which is used to create the basic objects that are used in the program.
You will work on the file <a href="lab13-files/lab13.html">lab13.html</a>.

<p>This lab is due at our next lab period, on Tuesday, December&nbsp;2.
For the final lab, on that day, you will work on a program in class
and will get credit for showing up and getting the program at least
partly working.</p> 

<p>A short written progress report on your <a href="../final-project.html">final project</a> is due in class
on Monday, November 22.  You then need to meet with me at least once in the
period November&nbsp;29 to December&nbsp;6 to discuss the project and presentation.
And remember that the final project itself is due at the scheduled
file exam period, Thursday, December&nbsp;7, 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM.
You will also give your final project presentation at that time.

<h3>The project</h3>

<p><img align=right style="margin:8px" src="windmill.jpg" width="274" height="374">
The original <a href="lab13-files/lab13.html">lab13.html</a> shows a tiny box that
can be rotated by dragging your mouse on the canvas.  Your assignment is to
replace the box with a large windmill sitting on a rectangular base, as shown in the
picture at the right.  The vanes of the windmill should rotate when animation is
turned on.  Each vane of the windmill should be constructed from two cones,
as we have done in examples in the past.  For full credit, add the teapot to the
base of the windmill, as shown.  (See <a style="white-space:pre" href="lab13-files/teapot-model-IFS.js">teapot-model-IFS.js</a>.)</p>

<p>The program includes three instance variables representing basic objects:
<i>box</i>, <i>cone</i>, and <i>cylinder</i>.  These variables have instance
methods <i>box.render</i>(), <i>cone.render</i>(), and <i>cylinder.render</i>()
that can be called to draw the objects.  The untransformed objects are of size
1 in all three directions, and they have their centers at (0,0,0).  The
axis of the cone and the axis of the cylinder are aligned along the <span class=nb>z-axis</span>.
All objects in the scene should be transformed versions of the three basic objects or of
a basic teapot object.
</p>

<p>By the way, this is procedural graphics, not scene graph based.  You will probably want
to write functions to draw some of the complex objects.</p>
