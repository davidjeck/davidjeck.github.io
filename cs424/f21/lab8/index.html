<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Spring 2021<br>
Lab 8: A Merry-Go-Round in three.js</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>In this lab you will build a complex animated model using three.js.  
You will need a copy of the folder
<a href="lab8-files/" style="white-space:pre">lab8-files</a>, which you can find in
<i style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs424</i> as usual (or download this
<a href="lab8-files.zip">zip&nbsp;archive</a> and unpack it).
You will work on the file
<a href="lab8-files/merry-go-round.html">merry-go-round.html</a>.  The files include 
two texture images that I used in my own merry-go-round.  You can use them if you
want, and you can add other image files to that folder if you want to use them instead.</p>

<p>As an example of building scenes in three.js, you have 
the <a href="windmill/windmill.html" style="white-space:pre">windmill and earth/moon</a> scene that
I talked about in class on Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>In lab next week, you can work on the midterm project.
There will be another three.js lab in two weeks.  Your merry-go-round will be collected along
with the work from that lab.</b></p>

<h3>The Assignment</h3>

<p>The assignment is to use three.js to make a merry-go-round with eight horses.  The merry-go-round
must have a top and a bottom and a pole for each horse. When animation is turned on, the merry-go-round
must rotate, and the horses must go up and down.  But the horses should not all move in synchrony.  In my
version, there are two groups of four horses.  One group is going up while the other is going down.
(Each group of four horses was made using a <i>THREE.Object3D</i> as parent for the four horses, 
so that I could move the group as a unit.)  
You should place some object at the center of the merry-go-round, and apply a texture to that object.
Here is a screen shot of my version:</p>

<p class=np align=center><img src="merry-go-round.png" width="655" height="341"></p>

<p>Some notes... Three.js has its own methods for loading images and models, but they have the same problem
that you had when loading them for OpenGL last week.  The details are discussed in the next section.</p>

<p><img src="just-geometry.png" width="204" height="109" align=right>
You should start by building the merry-go-round without the horses and without textures, as shown on the right.
You can also make the merry-go-round rotate when animation is turned on.</p>

<p>You should make a THREE.Object3D to represent the entire merry-go-round. You can rotate the merry-go-round
by applying a rotation about the y-axis to that object.</p>

<p>For the top and bottom of my merry-go-round, I used very flat cylinders with a radius of 10.  Three.js cylinders
have their centers at (0,0,0) and their axis lying along the y-axis, so I just moved one cylinder up 
and the other down by the same amount,
to leave the center of the merry-go-round at (0,0,0), where the camera is aimed.
I added a cone above the top cylinder to make it look more interesting.</p>

<p>The poles are also cylinders.  Note that to get a pole into
position, it is easiest to first translate it to a point near the edge of the merry-go-round, then rotate it
about the origin to get it into position.  Since the transformations on a given object are applied in
the order scale/rotate/translate, you will need an extra <i>Object3D</i> for each pole (except the first),
in order to do a rotation of the pole <b>after</b> it has been translated.  
(This is similar to the moon in <a href="windmill/windmill.html">windmill.html</a>.) Note that rotation angles
are given in radians, and the rotations for the poles are given by multiples of Math.PI/4.</p>

<p>Remember that you can use the <i>clone</i>() function in a THREE.Object3D to get full copy of the
object.</p>

<p>My poles have a subtle color variation that is due to a paisley texture applied to a white pole.  Since the
texture is rather stretched and distorted, it mainly just gives the poles a kind-of mottled appearance.
The basic material of the object in the center is also white, before the texture is added.</p>

<p>There is only one light in the original scene.  You will probably want to add some additional lighting.
I added two rather dim lights, a directional light shining from above and a point light at the center of the
merry-go-round.</p>

<p>Once you have the basic object built, you can add code to the <i>createWorld</i>()
function to start the process of loading the horse model and the texture images, as
described in the next section.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>Loading the Textures and Horse Model</h3>

<p>You are required to use a texture on at least the central object of the merry-go-round.
It is easy to load and apply the texture, using the <i>loadTextureFor</i>() method that is
already included in <i style="white-space:pre">merry-go-round.html</i>.  You only need to
call the function, with appropriate parameters, in the <i>createWorld</i>() method.  The same function
is used in <a href="windmill/windmill.html">windmill.html</a> to load the earth and moon textures.
Note that using this function, textured objects will first appear without the textures, and the
textures will be added after the texture image has finished loading.</p>

<p>The horse model is the file <i>Horse.glb</i>.  The class THREE.GTLFLoader can be used to
load models of this type.  See <a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c5/s2.html#threejs.2.5">Subsection&nbsp;5.2.5</a>
in the textbook for information about loading models.  The loading can be started in <i>createWorld</i>()
with two lines of code:</p>

<pre class=code>
    let loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();
    loader.load("Horse.glb", addHorsesToScene);
</pre>

<p>Here, <i>addHorsesToScene</i> is the name of a callback function that will be called when the
model has been loaded.  As the name says, it should add the eight horses to the merry-go-round.
You need to write this function, and its purpose is, as it says, to add
the horses to the merry-go-round.  The callback function <i>addHorsesToScene</i>() will be 
passed a parameter that contains the data for the model
that has been loaded.  Unfortunately, the structure of GLTF files can be quite complicated, and
it is not always easy to tell what the data from a GLTF model will
contain.  For the <i>Horse.glb</i> file, if <i>data</i> is the parameter in <i>addHorsesToScene</i>(), you can get the
horse model from the data with:</p>

<pre class=code>
   let horse = data.scene.children[0];
</pre>

<p class=np>Then, <i>horse</i> will be a THREE.Mesh complete with the geometry and material
that defines the horse.  This model, and clones of it, are used directly for the brown horses
in my merry-go-round.</p>

<p>Note however that the horse model is huge! <b>I applied a scaling factor of 0.02 to the horse.</b>
You will have to translate and rotate the horses to get them into position at the centers of the poles of the
merry-go-round.  As with the poles, it is easiest to translate the horse to the edge of the merry-go-round
and use a separate THREE.Object3D to rotate it about the y-axis into its correct position.
Work on getting one horse into the correct position and orientation first!</p>

<p>In my merry-go-round, the brown horses move up as the colored horses move down and vice-versa.
To implement this, the four brown horses are children of the same THREE.Object3D, and only the
parent object has to be moved up and down.  The four colored horses are children of another THREE.Object3D
that is animated separately.</p>

<p>It turns out that a simple sine function such as <i>Math.sin(frameNumber/25)</i>, maybe multiplied by
a constant, works pretty well as the y-coordinate for moving the horses up and down.</p>

<p>That only leaves the question of how to get colored horses.  You are not necessarily required to do this,
and it took me a while to figure out.  The idea is simple:  Substitute a different material for the horse.
The problem was that because of the way its colors are applied, the horse doesn't come with normal vectors.
You can get three.js to create normal vectors by saying,</p>

<pre class=code>
    horse.geometry.computeVertexNormals();
</pre>

<p class=np>It will then work with a new material, which you can install with a command such as</p>

<pre class=code>
    horse.material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0xBB2222 }) ;
</pre>

<p class=np>I did something similar for each of the four colored horses in my scene.</p>
