<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 9:  Work on the Midterm Project</h2>

<div class="intro">


<p>For this week's lab, you can continue work on the
<a href="../lab6/index.html">midterm project</a>, which
you started in Lab&nbsp;6.  This page has a little additional
help about implementing cameras as scene graph nodes.</p>

<p><b>Midterm projects are due next Thursday.</b>  They should be copied into the
folder that was set up for your group in <span style="white-space;pre">/classes/cs424</span>.
Remember that in addition to the API itself, you need to create some examples
that use it.  Each person in the group is supposed to create an example, and
get graded on that example individually.  The grade for the API, on the other
hand, is a group grade.  Make sure that each example clearly identifies who
wrote it.  One group has asked whether they can
turn in one large and elaborate example instead of individual
examples, and get graded graded on that example as a group.  That will be OK
as long as everyone in the group agrees.</p>

<p>As I grade your project, I might want to ask you about the decisions that
you made as you designed and implemented your API.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>Camera Nodes</h3>

<p>One of the requirements for the API is to implement scene graph nodes that
represent cameras.  This requires parent pointers in the nodes.  You already
received an email from me with a new version of my simple 2D API that uses
parent pointers:  <a href="scene_graph_2d_new.js">scene_graph_2d_new.js</a>
and an example that uses it, <a href="SceneGraph_new.html">SceneGraph_new.html</a>.
(I hope that your scene graph API does not simply add a third dimension to this
2D API. Even if you do something similar, you also have to think about lighting
and materials and maybe textures.)</p>

<p>Remember that the point of having a camera in the scene graph is that
modeling transfomations that are applied to the camera node are used to set
up the viewing transformation for the scene.  To do that, you have to start
at the camera node and follow parent pointers to the root of the scene graph.
Along the way, you have to apply the inverse of any modeling transformations 
that are applied to the nodes that you visit.  This is explained in more detail in
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c4/s4.html#gl1light.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;4.4.2</a>.
</p>

<p>To render a scene, you need a projection transformation as well as a viewing transformation.
One way to do that is to set up the projection directly, using <i>glFrustum</i>() or more likely
<i>gluPerspective</i>() for a perspective projection.  For example,</p>

<pre class=code>
     glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
     glLoadIdentity();
     gluPerspective( fova, aspect, near, far );
     glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
     // Now, set the viewing transformation
</pre>

<p class=np>This approach does not use the camera object that is included in glsim.js.  But it is
possible to use that object if you want to..  Calling <i>camera.apply</i>() sets
up both the projection transformation and the viewing transformation that have been configured into the
camera by calling its methods.  You would call <i>camera.apply</i>() before applying the transformations
that affect the camera node, because <i>camara.apply</i>() completely replaces any viewing transformation
that was in effect before it is called.
It is probably best to leave the viewing transformation in the camera
itself set to the identity transformation.  That is, 
leave the camera at (0,0,0), looking down the negative z-axis, in its own coordinate system.
This will make it easier to understand how the modeling transformations that are applied to the 
camera node will affect the view.</p>

<p>Once the projection and viewing transformations have been established, 
you are ready traverse the scene graph to render the scene.</p>
