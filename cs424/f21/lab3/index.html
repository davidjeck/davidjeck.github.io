<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 3: Hierarchical Modeling</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p>Once again in this lab, you will be making picures by applying modeling transformations
to basic shapes.  But in this case, the modeling will be hierarchical.  That is, you can
have compound objects that are made from transformed simpler objects.  Furthermore, some of the
objects in this lab will animated by applying different modeling transformations in different
frames.</p>

<p>The three files that you need are in the directory /classes/cs424/lab3-files,
or you can get them through these links:
you will need copies of the files
<a href="lab3-files/SubroutineHierarchy.html">SubroutineHierarchy.html</a>,
<a href="lab3-files/SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph.html</a>, and
<a href="lab3-files/scene_graph_2d.js">scene_graph_2d.js</a>.
The third file is a JavaScript file that defines the scene graph API that 
is used in SceneGraph.html.  A &lt;script> element in SceneGraph.html
includes scene_graph_2d.js into that program.  You will not make any
changes to scene_graph_2d.js.</p>

<p>Both programs are set up to use a coordinate system with x ranging from
-4 on the left to 4 on the right and y ranging from -3 at the bottom to 3 at the
top.  You can use a different coordinate system if you prefer.  Just change the
values of the constants X_LEFT, X_RIGHT, Y_TOP, and Y_BOTTOM.</p>

<p>There are three exercises for this lab.  For the first exercise, you will
work on SubroutineHierarchy.html, to create a specific animated scene.
For the second exercise, you will work on SceneGraph.html to create the
same scene.  The third exercise asks you to create an animated hierarchical
scene of your own design, using a copy of either SubroutineHierarcy.html or
SceneGraph.html as your starting point.</p>

<p><b>Turning in your work:</b>
Your programs should be submitted by the beginning of the lab period next Thursday.
They should be in a folder named <i>lab3</i> or <i>lab3-files</i> inside your homework folder in
<i style="white-space:pre:">/classes/cs424/homework</i>.  Please submit your the
three .html files for the three exercises, along with a copy of
scene_graph_2d.js to make it possible to run your scene graph work.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>Exercise 1: Subroutine Hierarchy</h3>

<p>For the first exercise, you will draw compound objects using subroutines.  You should work on the
file <a href="lab3-files/SubroutineHierarchy.html">SubroutineHierarchy.html</a>.
The file already contains subroutines
that draw certain basic shapes.  You will need to write subroutines to draw the more complex objects that appear
in the scene.  The subroutines that you write can call the subroutines for drawing basic shapes, and they can call other subroutines
that you have written.  Here is the scene that you should create:</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="wheels.png" width="650" height="472"/></p>

<p class="np">You need a subroutine to draw an object consisting of a triangle and a bar, with two
wheels on the ends of the bar.  The scene is made up of three copies of the object.  When the
animation is run, The wheels rotate about their center, while at the same time the bar is moving
up and down like a seesaw.
You will first want to create (with another subroutine) a wheel, consisting of a circle and some lines:</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="onewheel.png" width="118" height="110"/></p>

<p class="np">You can the build on that to create a bar with rotating wheels on its ends:</p>

<p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="bar.png" width="500" height="174"/></p>

<p class="np">You can then build the main object and put copies of it in the scene.  Keep in mind
that you can test each of the subroutines as you write them, in order to make sure that they are working
before you try to use them in a more complex object &mdash; just call the subroutine directly in 
<i>drawWorld</i>().</p>

<p>You will need to save and restore the graphics context's transform many times, using
the functions <i>graphics.save</i>() and <i>graphics.restore</i>().)</p>

<p>One question is, how to implement a rotation that oscillates back and forth between two
angles.  You need to compute the angle from the value of <i>frameNumber</i>.  Let's say
your want one oscillation to last 100 time units.  Note that <i>frameNumber%100</i> will
repeatedly go through values from 0 to 100.  During the first half of a period, the angle
should decrease; during the second half it should increase.  Let's say that you want
the angle to oscillate between -Math.PI/6 and +Math.PI/6.  Then the angle can be computed
as</p>

<pre class=code>
let step = frameNumber % 100;
if (step > 50) {
    step = 100 - step;
}
let angle = -Math.PI/6 + (step/50 * Math.PI/3);
</pre>

<p>The web page <a href="SubroutineHierarchyExample.html">SubroutineHierarchyExample.html</a>
is the cart-and-windmill example that we looked at in class.  It's the same scene as a demo in.
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c2/s4.html">Section&nbsp;2.4</a>, although the
code isn't the same as the code in the demo.  This is a much more complicated example
of hierarchical modeling using subroutines, but you can look at the source code of 
the web page to review how it is done.</p>


</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Exercise 2: Scene Graph</h3>

<p>For the second exercise, you should make exactly the same animated scene as for the first exercise,
but you should create it by building a scene graph to represent the contents of the scene.
For this exercise, you should work on the file
<a href="lab3-files/SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph.html</a>.
The scene graph API that is used in this file is defined in
<a href="lab3-files/scene_graph_2d.js">scene_graph_2d.js</a>,
and you can refer to that file to see the available classes and
methods.  We discussed the API in class on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The web page <a href="SceneGraphExample.html">SceneGraphExample.html</a>
is the cart-and-windmill example implemented using the scene graph API.
Again, you can view the source code for that page to see how it's done.
Also, there is the "people walking" example that we talked about in
class on Wednesday here: <a href="Walkers.html">Walkers.html</a>.</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Exercise 3: Complex Scene</h3>
<p>As a final exercise, you should design and implement your own complex animated scene using
hierarchical modeling.  You can use either the subroutine or the scene graph approach.  Start with
a renamed copy of either <a href="lab3-files/SubroutineHierarchy.html">SubroutineHierarchy.html</a>
or <a href="lab3-files/SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph.html</a>.</p>

<p>Your scene should include several
different complex objects, and it should have multiple copies of at least one of those objects.
At least one of the models must have moving parts (like the wheels on the cart or the vanes
on the windmills.)  Although I don't necessarily expect it to be as complex as
the cart-and-windmills example, you should
try for something as "realistic" as the cart-and-windmill example.
If you can't think of anything else, how about a rotating ferris wheel, with rectangles or triangles for
the seats.  (Note that on a ferris wheel, the seats remain horizontal as the wheel turns.)
Or you could make walking people.
You could add some clouds drifting across the sky (made from a few filled circles that move
around so the cloud changes shape).  
Maybe someone swinging in a swing?  Or a sailboat that floats across a lake?  A creepy house where
blinds move up and down the window?
Of course, there's always the possibility of a snowman &mdash; maybe his head could roll
back and forth on his arms!</p>
