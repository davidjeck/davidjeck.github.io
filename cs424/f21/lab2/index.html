<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 2: 2D Graphics with HTML Canvas</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p>This lab consists of two exercises
on drawing with the HTML canvas 2D graphics API, which is
covered in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>.
It requires some knowledge of JavaScript, which was covered briefly in
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/a1/s3.html">Section&nbsp;A.3</a>.</p>

<p>You will need copies of the following files, which you can find in
<i class="nb">/classes/cs424/lab2-files</i> or download from the Web:
<a href="lab2-files/Lab2Ex1.html">Lab2Ex1.html</a> and
<a href="lab2-files/Lab2Ex2.html">Lab2Ex2.html</a>.  You can edit
these files with any text editor, or with Komodo Edit.  </p>


<p><b>Turning in your work:</b>
Your programs must be submitted by the beginning of the lab period next Thursday.
They must be in a folder named <i>lab2</i> or <i>lab2-files</i> inside your homework folder in
<i>/classes/cs424/homework</i>.</p>

<p><b>For this lab, you should add appropriate comments to the new code that
you write.</b></p>

<h3>Exercise 1:  Shapes</h3>

<p>The file <a href="lab2-files/Lab2Ex1.html">Lab2Ex1.html</a> is set up to
do basic drawing in an HTML canvas.  For the first exercise of the lab, you should
add new drawing code to the <i>draw</i>() function in that file
to draw the following picture, including the horizontal and vertical dividing lines.
(The black border around the canvas is part of the web page, not something that
is drawn on the canvas.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="np">
<img src="ex1.png" width="609" height="610">
</p>

<p>A significant part of the exercise is using Bezier curves to draw the two shapes 
on the right.  Both shapes are created as paths, using <i>g.beginPath()</i> and
related functions.  The blue shape on the top right has a single Bezier curve
as its upper boundary.  The other three sides are straight lines.
The heart can be drawn as a path made up of two Bezier curves. I suggest that you
try making a heart in the
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/demos/c2/cubic-bezier.html">Bezier curve demo</a>
from <a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c2/s2.html"/>Section&nbsp;2.2</a>
to get some idea of where the control points need to be placed.  It will take some
experimentation to get the shape right!</p>

<p>The size of the canvas is 600-by-600.  You can use the standard pixel coordinates, or you can
apply transformations to use more convenient coordinates for drawing the shapes.  
If you use a scaling transformation, remember
that line width is also transformed! In fact, I
used plain pixel coordinates for some of the pictures and a simple translation transformation
for the others, so that I could draw them originally at the origin. If you do use transforms,
remember that you can use <i>g.save</i>() and <i>g.restore</i>() to save and
restore the current transform.</p>

<p>The 2D graphics context in the program is named <i>g</i>.  It has all the properties
discussed in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a> of
the textbook.  In addition, the following non-standard drawing commands have been added to&nbsp;<i>g</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>g.strokeLine(x1,y1,x2,y2)</code> &mdash; draw the line segment from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).</li>
<li><code>g.strokeCircle(x,y,r)</code> &mdash; stroke the circle with center (x,y) and radius&nbsp;r.</li>
<li><code>g.strokeOval(x,y,rx,ry)</code> &mdash; stroke the oval with center (x,y), horizontal radius rx, and vertical radius&nbsp;ry.</li>
<li><code>g.strokePoly(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,...)</code> &mdash; stroke the polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3),&nbsp;...</li>
<li><code>g.fillCircle(x,y,r)</code> &mdash; fill the circle with center (x,y) and radius&nbsp;</li>
<li><code>g.fillOval(x,y,rx,ry)</code> &mdash; fill the oval with center (x,y), horizontal radius rx, and vertical radius&nbsp;ry.</li>
<li><code>g.fillPoly(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,...)</code> &mdash; fill the polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3),&nbsp;...</li>
</ul>

<p class=np>Note carefully the parameters for ovals and circles, which might not be 
what you are used to from Java graphics.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2: Events and HTML Elements</h3>

<p>For the second exercise, you will work with <a href="lab2-files/Lab2Ex2.html">Lab2Ex2.html</a>,
a program that implements mouse interaction.  (It is actually set up to work with either
a mouse or a touchscreen.)  As it stands, the program draws a multicolored sequence of squares
as the user drags the mouse on the canvas.  You will make it possible to use various (single)
colors for drawing, and you will implement various "tools" to let the user draw different shapes.
 In addition to using some HTML graphics commands,
this exercise is supposed to give you a little experience with working with GUI in
HTML/JavaScript.</p>

<p class="np">Here is a screenshot of my completed version of the
program, showing shapes drawn using a variety of color and tool selections.
Above the drawing is a "Clear Drawing" button and two popup menus
that let the user select the color and tool.  The button is part of the
original program, but you will have to add the popup menus.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="np">
<img src="ex2.png" width="494" height="418"">
</p>




<p>A drag action consists of a mouse down event, a sequence of mouse move events, and
a mouse up event.  The program defines a function <i>startDrag</i>() that it calls in
response to a mouse down event, and it defines a <i>continueDrag</i>() function that it
calls in response to each mouse move event that occurs while the user moves the mouse
while holding down the mouse button.  To implement
the colors and new tools, you can work entirely in the function <i>continueDrag</i>().
(You might also add something to <i>startDrag</i>(), but you only really
need to do that to make things a little more efficient.)
Aside from implementing the colors and tools, there are a few more things that have 
to be added to the web page to set up the GUI and make it work.  The instructions
for doing that are somewhat tutorial in nature.</p>

<hr width="33%">

<p><b>First,</b> you should implement the "Clear Drawing" button that is already
part of the web page.  When the user clicks the
button, the canvas should be filled with white. You can write a <i>doClear</i>() function
to do the clearing, but you also have to arrange for that function to be called when
the user clicks the button.  You need to set up <i>doClear</i> as the event handler
for click events on the button.  The button is already created, near the end of the web page
source code, by the HTML element</p>

<pre class=code>
&lt;button id="clearBtn">&lt;b>Clear Drawing&lt;/b>&lt;/button>
</pre>

<p class=np>You can install the event handler with the JavaScript statement</p>

<pre class=code>
document.getElementById("clearBtn").onclick = doClear;
</pre>

<p class=np>But where should that statement go?  It can't be executed while the page is
loading since the button won't exist at that time.  It has to go in a function that
won't be called until the page has been completely loaded into the web browser.
In this course, I will always do that with a function named <i>init</i>().  The <i>init</i>()
function is called to do any initialization of the program, after the page has finished being
loaded.  That can be arranged with the statement <i>window.onload&nbsp;=&nbsp;init</i>,
which you can find in the web page source code.</p>

<p>The upshot is, simply, that you should define a <i>doClear</i>() function somewhere
on the page, and add the statement that installs it as event handler to the definition
of the <i>init</i>() function.</p>

<hr width="33%">

<p><b>Second,</b> you should create and implement a "Color" popup menu.  You have to
add HTML code to the page to create the menu, maybe do some initialization in
<i>init</i>() function, and then use the current selection from the menu to decide 
what color to draw with in the <i>continueDrag</i>() method.</p>

<p>A pop-up menu in HTML is a &lt;select> element.  The entries in the menu are 
given by &lt;option> elements inside the select element.  Here is some HTML
code that will create the color menu that you need:</p>

<pre class=code>
&lt;select id="colorSelect">
   &lt;option value="MULTI">Multicolor&lt;/option>
   &lt;option value="black">Black&lt;/option>
   &lt;option value="red">Red&lt;/option>
   &lt;option value="green">Green&lt;/option>
   &lt;option value="blue">Blue&lt;/option>
&lt;/select>
</pre>

<p class=np>You can add this code to the same paragraph that contains the &lt;button>.
You can certainly add more colors, if you want.</p>


<p>Since you will use this menu a lot, I suggest defining a global variable, say <i>colorMenu</i>,
to refer to it.  You can get the reference to the menu by setting</p>

<pre class=code>
colorMenu = document.getElementById("colorSelect");
</pre>

<p class=np>in the <i>init</i>() method.  Any time you want to know which option
is currently selected in the menu, you can simply use <i>colorMenu.value</i>.
This represents the <i>value</i> attribute in the &lt;option> element.
The value is always of type "string".  Note that in this case, all of the value
strings, except for "MULTI", can be used directly as the value of
<i>g.fillStyle</i> or <i>g.strokeStyle</i>.  (You don't need to implement events
for the popup menu.  Your program can simply check <i>colorMenu.value</i> whenever
it needs to know the selected value.)</p>

<hr width="33%">

<p><b>Third,</b> add a second &lt;select&gt; element that will let the user select the
drawing tool that they want to use, set up event handling for the menu, 
and implement the menu by adding code to the
<i>continueDrag</i>() function.  This is the largest part of the exercise.  You should
add at least five new tools.  They must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A tool similar to the original squares tool, except that it draws ovals instead of
squares.</li>
<li>A tool similar to the original squares tool, except that it draws a non-trivial shape
such as a heart or a star.  (Non-trivial means that you need to create it as a path
or polygon.  In particular, <b>not</b> just rectangles or ovals.)  It can useful
to write a function to draw the shape, and it might be convenient to draw it at
the origin and use a translation transformation, along with <i>g.save</i>() and
<i>g.restore</i>(), to place it at the mouse location.</li>
<li>A Line tool that simply draws a line segment from the previous mouse position to the current mouse position.
Note that the variables <i>prevX</i> and <i>prevY</i> are already defined to represent the
previous mouse position.  A thick line would be nice, and to make it look prettier, you will
want to set <i>g.lineCap&nbsp;=&nbsp;"round"</i>.</li>
<li>A tool that uses the starting position of the mouse, which is given by the variables
<i>startX</i> and <i>startY</i>, as well as the current position.  For example, draw
a circle with center at the starting point and passing through the current position.</li>
<li>One additional tool of your choice.  I made a tool that draws lines from 
(startX,startY) to (x,y).  Or you might consider an "erase" tool that
simply draws in white.  Another possibility is drawing some text at the mouse position.</li>
</ul>

<p class=np>Here's what's in my Tool menu:</p>
