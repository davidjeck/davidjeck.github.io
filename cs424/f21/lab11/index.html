<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 11: WebGL 1.0 2D and GLSL</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>This is our first lab using WebGL and GLSL.  For now, we will stick to 2D and WebGL&nbsp;1.0.
 The starting point for the
lab is <a href="lab11.html">lab11.html</a>, which is the only file that
you will need today.  You can find a copy in
<i style="white-space: pre">/classes/cs424</i>.</p>

<p><b>Your work for this lab is due next Thursday.  Please turn in the file lab11.html.</b></p>

<h3>The project</h3>

<p>The program in <i>lab11.html</i> currently shows a number of moving red squares that
bounce off the edges of the canvas.  The canvas fills the entire content area of the
web browser.  The squares also respond to the mouse: If you left-click or left-click-and-drag
on the canvas, all of the square will head towards the position of the mouse.
If you shift-left-click, the data for the points is reinitialized, so they start back at
the center.  You can pause and restart the animation by hitting the space bar.</p>

<p>The squares are in fact all part of one WebGL primitive of type <i>gl.POINTS</i>.
Each square corresponds to one of the vertices of the primitive.  Of course, the 
rendering is actually done by a vertex shader and a fragment shader.  The source
code for the shaders is in two constant multiline strings at the top of the program.</p>

<p>You will be modifying the shader code and the JavaScript code to implement several
different styles for the point primitive.  For example, it will be possible to draw
the squares in different colors, to draw disks instead of squares, and so on.
As a final step, you will make it possible to draw lines connecting the points.
The user will control the program by hitting keys on the keyboard.  It's up to you 
to decide which keys to use, but please document the interface in an appropriate
comment on the <i>doKey</i>() function or at the top of the program.</p>

<p>The Javascript side of the program has three functions that you will need to work on:  The function <i>initGL</i>() is
called once when the program first starts and the functions <i>updateForFrame</i>() and <i>render</i>()
are called once for each frame of the animation.  The same set of commands would be legal in all of
these, but <i>initGL</i>() is the best place to set up things that won't change during the
run of the program, such as the locations of the uniform and attribute variables in the shader program;
<i>updateForFrame</i>() is intended to be used for updating JavaScript variables that change from
frame to frame; and <i>render</i>() is meant to do the actual WebGL drawing of the frame.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>Color Attribute</h3>


<p>In the original version of the program, all of the squares are red.  The first exercise is to allow the
possibility of assigning a different color to each square.  
Since the squares are really vertices in a single primitive of type <i>gl.POINTS</i>,
you can use an <i>attribute variable</i> for the color.  An attribute can have a different value
for each vertex.</p>

<p>Your first task is to add a color attribute variable of type <i>vec3</i> to the vertex shader, and use the
values of the attribute to color the squares.  You will also have to work on the JavaScript side.
You will need a <i>Float32Array</i> to hold the color values on the JavaScript side, and you will
need a WebGL buffer for the attribute.  The program already has one attribute, which is used for
the coordinates of the vertices.  You will be doing something similar for the color attribute
&mdash; except that you should do it all in <i>initGL</i>() since the color values won't change after they
are created.  You can use random values in the range 0.0 to 1.0 for the color components.</p>

<p>After you get multi-colored squares working, you should make the colors optional.
(You might also allow other uniform colors for the points, in addition to red.)
You can turn the use of the attribute value array on and off using the following commands,
where <i>a_color_loc</i> is the id for the color attribute in the shader program:</p>

<pre class=code>
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(a_color_loc);   // use the color attribute buffer

gl.disableVertexAttribArray(a_color_loc);  // don't use the buffer
</pre>

<p class=np>When the attribute array is enabled, each vertex gets its own color, from the attribute buffer.
When the attribute array is disabled, all vertices get the same color, and that value
is set using the <i>gl.vertexAttrib*</i> family of functions.  For example, to use a uniform
red color, you can disable the vertex attribute array and set the color by calling</p>

<pre class="code">
gl.vertexAttrib3f(a_color_loc, 1, 0, 0);  // set attrbute color to red
</pre>

<p>Let the user hit some specific keys to control the colors.
The program has a <i>doKey</i>() function that is already set up to respond to keyboard input.
You will be adding several types of keyboard interaction to the program.  To respond to a key,
you need to know the numeric keycode for that key.
The <i>doKey</i>() function outputs the keycode to the console every time the user hits a key, and
you can use that feature to discover any other keycodes that you need.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>Point Style</h3>

<p>Square points are boring.  You should add the option of using different display styles for
the points.  Let the user select the style using the keyboard; for example, by hitting
number keys, or by hitting some key to cycle through the possibilities.</p>

<p>The styles will have to be implemented in the fragment shader, and you will
need a new <i>uniform variable</i> to tell the fragment shader which style to use.
Add a uniform variable of type <i>int</i> to the fragment shader to control the point style,
and add code to the fragment shader to implement the various styles.  You will also
need to add a variable on the JavaScript side for the location of the uniform variable,
and you will need to call <i>glUniform1i</i> when you want to change the style.</p>

<p>The basic square
should be one possible style.  Some of the styles should
be disks instead of squares.  We saw in class how to draw a point as a disk by discarding some pixels:</p>

<pre class=code>
float dist = distance( vec2(0.5), gl_PointCoord );
if (dist > 0.5) {
    discard;
}
</pre>

<p class="np">You should also make use of alpha transparency in some of your styles. To
enable use of the alpha component, you need to add the following lines to the
<i>initGL</i>() function:</p>

<pre class=code>
gl.enable(gl.BLEND);
gl.blendFunc(gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
</pre>

<p class=np>With these settings, the alpha value of a color will be used for transparency
in the usual way.  <b>In particular, one of your styles should show a point as a disk that fades
from fully opaque at the center of the disk to fully transparent at the edge.</b></p>

<p>Other ideas include drawing a diamond shape or a ring (by discarding
pixels except in a small range of values of <i>dist</i>).  Be creative! </p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Line Primitive</h3>

<p>To add some visual interest, make it possible to draw line segments connecting each
point to the next.  In fact, you can draw all the lines as a single primitive of type
<i>gl.LINE_LOOP</i>, <i>gl.LINE_STRIP</i>, or <i>gl.LINES</i>, 
using the same vertex coordinates and colors that are used for the <i>gl.POINTS</i>
primitive.  The only difficulty is that the fragment shader will need to know
whether it is drawing a point primitive or a line primitive, since <i>gl_PointCoord</i>
is not defined for a  line primitive, and all the code that you just wrote for point styles
won't make sense for lines.  (Another option would
be to use another shader program for drawing the lines.)</p>

<p>You should make it possible to draw lines only, points only, or both lines and points.
You might allow two styles for lines:  <i>gl.LINES</i> and either <i>gl.LINE_LOOP</i> or
<i>gl.LINE_STRIP</i>.</p>

<p>Note that line width can be set by calling <i>gl.lineWidth</i>(<i>w</i>), where the
width, <i>w</i>, is given in pixels.  Wide lines look better, but it is possible that
the actual maximum line width is as small as one pixel.</p>
