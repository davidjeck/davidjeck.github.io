<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 14: Procedural Textures</h2>

<div class="intro">


<p>This is meant to be another genuinely short lab that you might finish during the
lab period.  As long as you come to lab and make a reasonable effort during
lab, you will get full credit for Lab&nbsp;14.</p>

<p>In this version of the lab, you will work with procedural textures in WebGL.  The procedural textures 
will be implemented in a GLSL fragment shader.  In addition, you will make it possible to
scale the texture coordinates to change the number of times that the basic texture
repeats on an object.</p>

<p>You will need a copy of the folder <a href="lab14-files/">lab14-files</a> from
<i style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs424</i>. (Or you can download and extract the zip archive,
<a style="white-space:pre" href="lab14-files.zip">lab14-files.zip</a>.)
The starting point for the lab is the file <a style="white-space:pre" href="lab14-files/lab14.html">lab14.html</a>,
which already implements a couple of procedural textures.  The other four files in the  folder
are the JavaScript files that are required by the program.  You will only work on <span style="white-space:pre">lab14.html</span>.
The program is based on the
demo <a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/demos/c7/procedural-textures.html" style="white-space:pre">procedural-textures.html</a>
from <a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c7/s3.html#webgl3d.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;7.3.3</a></p>

<p><b>You will not turn in any work for this lab.  You will get full credit for
showing up and showing me some completed work at the end of the lab.</b>

<h3>About 3D Procedural Textures</h3>

<p>You have used procedural textures, such as marble and clouds, in Blender.  In a procedural
texture, the texture color is computed, based on texture coordinates, rather than sampled from an image.
For a 3D procedural texture, there are three texture coordinates, (<i>s,t,r</i>), instead of two.
Typically, object coordinates are used as texture coordinates, though they can of course be
subject to a texture transformation.  A 3D texture is a pattern in three-dimensional space.  
When it is applied to an object, it is as if the object is "carved" out of that pattern.</p>

<p>The original <i><a href="lab14-files/lab14.html">lab14.html</a></i> has three procedural textures: a checkerboard texture, a cloud texture,
and a marble texture.  For clouds and marble, some kind of pseudo-randomness is needed.  A common kind of
pseudo-randomness for 3D textures is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin&nbsp;noise</a>.
The cloud texture is pure Perlin noise.  For the marble texture, the Perlin noise is used to 
perturb a periodic function.  In the program, Perlin noise is implemented by an open-source
GLSL function.  (No, I don't understand how it works.)  See
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c7/s3.html#webgl3d..3">Section&nbsp;7.3.3</a> for more
details about procedural textures and Perlin noise.</p>

<h3>Implementing the textures</h3>

<p>The purpose of the lab is to add several new procedural textures.  You should
add new entries in the pop-up menu that selects the texture, and you should add code to
the fragment shader to implement the textures.  Here are some examples:</p>

<p class=np align=center><img style="padding:4px; border:thin solid black" src="textures.png" width="705" height="161"></p>

<p>At least one of your new textures should <b>not</b> use Perlin noise. It should be some
regular pattern, like the checkerboard.  (Consider making the color components depend on
sine functions, which are periodic.  Sine functions were used to make the multi-colored
texture on the left above.  Another type of periodic function is <i>f(t)&nbsp;=&nbsp;t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;floor(t)</i>,
a "triangular function" that
is used in the last two examples in the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/demos/c7/procedural-textures.html">demo</a>.)</p>

<p>At least two of the new textures should use Perlin noise.  They should not be trivial
variations on the textures that are already defined.  One option is to use Perlin noise as the
basis for the pattern, but to use only a limited number of colors, depending on the noise
value.  (Perlin noise has a value between -1.0 and&nbsp;1.0.)  The "cow" texture and the
"camo" texture in the illustration were made using this technique.</p>

<p>Ideally, however, one of your two noise
textures should be created by using the noise to perturb a regular pattern.  For example, the "wood"
texture on the right above used a basic idea of making rings by using a sine function of
the distance of <i>texCoords.xy</i> from (0,0).  (I had to multiply the distance by a
fairly large value to get the rings to be a reasonable size.  And it probably would have
worked better to use a function based on <i>f(t)&nbsp;=&nbsp;t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;floor(t)</i>.)  But the rings were
modified by adding a multiple of the noise function to the argument of the sine function
(similarly to what was done for the marble texture).
If you look closely, you will notice that the wood also has a subtler fine grain.
This was created by mixing into the color a dark brown multiplied by a noise function,
where the noise function was evaluated at vec3(32.0*cos(dist), 32.0*sin(dist), texCoords.z),
and <i>dist</i> is again the distance of texCoords.xy from (0,0).
The factor of 32.0 has the effect of greatly compressing the noise in the
radial direction.</p>
