<h2>CS 424: Computer Graphics, Fall 2021<br>
Blender Lab 3: Keyframe Animation</h2>

<div class="intro">


<p>For the third Blender lab, you will make an animation, starting with
the file <a href="frosty.blend">frosty.blend</a>.  (There is a copy
in <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs124</span>.)
This file already has all of the objects that you need, except
possibly for the "Something Extra" part of the lab.  Your goal is
to produce an animation very similar to this one:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
   <video width="600" height="450" controls>
      <source src="frosty-complete.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <b style="color:red">Sorry, but your browser can't show this video.</b>
   </video>
</p>

<p>The bit about the snowflakes is already partly done.  The animation
can be made entirely using keyframe animation, which is covered in
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/a2/s3.html#blender3.1">Section&nbsp;B.3.1</a>
&mdash; and you do not even need to know about F-curves.  Keyframe animation
in Blender was also demonstrated in class.</p>

<p><b>The work for this lab can be turned in up until Friday, November 12, and it
should be submitted along with your work for the
<a href="../blender2/index.html">second&nbsp;Blender&nbsp;lab</a>.
You should turn in the Blender files frosty.blend and modeling.blend,
an animation rendered from frosty.blend, and an image rendered from
modeling.blend.</b></p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>The Hat</h3>

<p>You should plan for an animation that is about 480 frames long, which will be
about 20 seconds long, at 24 frames per second.  In the first part of the animation,
the tophat should fly in from outside the frame and land on Frosty's head.  In my
version, this segment ends at frame number 145.  The way the hat flips over several
times before landing on Frosty's head was an accident, caused by the way that
Blender interpolates between rotations.</p>

<p>I suggest starting in frame 145, or whenever you want to end the segment, with the
hat on Frosty's head.  Work back from there to frame&nbsp;1.  Pay attention to the camera
view of the scene, to make sure that the hat stays in the picture.</p>

<p>Start by inserting a key frame for rotation and location at frame 145:  
Set the frame number to 145, for example
by dragging the blue tab in the Timeline at the bottom of the window.  Make sure the hat
is selected.
Press the <span style="white-space:pre">I-key</span>, and select "Rotation &amp; Location"
from the popup menu.</p>

<p>Set the frame number to a short time earlier.  Move and rotate the hat, then hit
<span style="white-space:pre">I-key</span> again to insert another rotation and location
keyframe.  This keyframe is a little touchy since you don't want the hat to cut through
Frosty's head.  Position the hat a little above the head, withtout too much rotation.
Test the animation by dragging the blue tab in the Timeline.  If necessary, you
can go to a key frame, adjust the location or rotation, and insert new key values
by using the <span style="white-space:pre">I-key</span> again.</p>

<p>Now you can work your way backward in time by repeating the process.  Decrease the frame 
number, adjust the location or position of the hat, and insert a key frame.   When you get
to Frame 1, the hat should be just outside the camera's view.</p>


</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>The Magic</h3>

<p>In the second segment of the animation, snowflakes of magic appear 
as if they are being emitted by a magic wand that is waving around Frosty.
The magic emerges from the hat, circles Frosty a few times, and drops to 
ground level.  This magic is implemented using a particle system.</p>

<p>The basic particle system is already set up.  If you zoom the view out,
you'll see three snowflakes under ground level.  There is also a small
sphere to the left of the snowflakes.  The sphere is the "emitter" for
the particle system.  What it emits is copies of the snowflakes.  The
original snowflakes are there just to serve as templates for the snowflakes
in the particle system.  Particle systems can be quite complicated, and
they are not covered in the textbook.  But this particle system is already 
mostly configured.  The only thing that you really need to change is the
frames where the particles start and stop.  In my version, the start frame
is 155 and the end frame is 270.  I also increased the number of particles to
be emitted.  To change those settings, select the sphere that emits the particles
and go to the Particle Properties, as shown here:</p>


<p class=np style="text-align:center"><img src="particle-settings.png" width=257 height=347>

<p class=np>The icon for accessing Particle Properties is the one just below the
wrench, as shown int he picture.  You want to set "Frame Start", "End", and
maybe "Number."</p>

<p>The sphere is the source of the particles.  You need to animate the sphere to
make the source of the particles move.  Move the sphere to its initial position,
above or close to Frosty's head.  <b>Note that the sphere will not appear in 
a rendered image.</b></p>

<p>Now, you could animate the sphere itself using keyframe animation, but here is
how I did it.  I placed an Empty at the origin, and made it the parent of the
sphere.  (Select the sphere, and add the Empty to the selection.  You might
find it easier to select the Empty by shift-clicking its name in the scene graph
view in the upper right.  Then use <span style="white-space:pre">Control-P</span>, 
and select Object from the popup menu.)  Then I applied keyframe animation to the
Empty.  I just had to animate the rotation of the Empty to make the sphere,
which is tethered to it, move the way I wanted.</p>

<p>With the Empty selected, I inserted a Rotation keyframe at the start time of the
motion.  Then I changed the frame number to the end time of the motion and used
the numerical inputs (<span style="white-space:pre">N-key</span>) to set the
X-rotation to -120 and the Z-rotation to 1080, and inserted a second keyframe
at that point.  Doing the animation this way, only two keyframes are needed.
(Getting the values right took a little experimentation.)</p>

<p>When you have things set up correctly, you should see the magic.</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Frosty Awakens</h3>

<p>In the last segment of the animation, after the magic, Frosty awakens.
Frosty turns his head to the left, pauses a bit, turns it to the right, pauses
a bit, looks forward, and smiles.</p>

<p>Note that Frosty's eyes, nose, mouth, and hat are all parented to the
head, so they will all move with the head when you animate that.  Use rotation
keyframes to make Frosty look up, left, right, and forward.  Don't make the motions
too fast, and do put a pause between the motions.  The animation looks better
with the pauses.</p>

<p>For the smile, you want to animate at least four of the five pieces of coal that
make the smile.  If they are all selected, you can insert Location keyframes for
them all at once.  You will have to move each piece up, but you will also have 
to move them forward a bit so that they are remain on the surface of the head.
This can be touchy.  You can select the head and its features and use the "/"
key if you want to work them in isolation.</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Something Extra</h3>

<p>Finally, you should add something extra to the animation. Be creative. For example,
you could have some text fly in with credits or some message.  If you are
ambitious, you might try to make it snow continuously by putting a large plane
above the scene and using it as an emitter for another particle system, but
you might need some help on that.  Maybe Frosty can walk away at the end;
since everything is ultimately parented to Frosty's base, you just have to
move that to make him move.  Maybe he can wave, but I should have given him
better arms for that.  My own extra is a little subtle:  As the magic
surrounds Frosty, he gets brighter and a little multicolored.  The effect
ends when the magic ends.  I do this by setting the input for the "Emission"
property of the material to be a Noise Texture, and animating the "Emission
Strength" property.</p>

<h3>Rendering an Animation</h3>

<p>Rendering animations is discussed in <a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/a2/s3.html#blender.3.6">Section&nbsp;B.3.4</a>.

The file <i>frosty.blend</i> is already configured to make an animation in MP4 format, and to save it in the
same directory as <i>frosty.blend</i> with a name such as <i>frosty0000-0480.mp4</i>.  
(But <b>be sure to set the end frame</b> for the animation to include the entire animation that you have created.)
You can render the
animation using the "Render Animation" command in the "Render" menu.  However, it will take quite a while &mdash; possibly
several hours on a lab computer.</p>

<p>It is nicer to let the animation render unattended in the background without having to stay logged
into the computer.  If you want to do this, note that Blender will only do background rendering for
the Cycles renderer; if you try to use Eevee for background rendering without access to a display, it will fail.  So be sure that the renderer is set to Cycles.
Also, unfortunately, there is a problem with the file system that is used for your home directory &mdash; the 
permission to access your home directory goes away when you log out.  However, it is possible to save the
animation in the /tmp directory, on the local computer.  You will just have to go back to the same computer
and copy it into your home directory when it has finished rendering.  (You might want to use one of the
csfac or cslab computers, which you can ssh to, so you don't have to go back to the computer physically.)
If you want to try this, log on to the computer, possibly using ssh.  Then create a folder in the /tmp directory,
copy <i>frosty.blend</i> into it, cd into that directory, and give the command for background rendering.
If you're in the directory that contains your <i>frosty.blend</i>, it looks like this:</p>

<pre class=code>
   mkdir /tmp/frosty
   cp frosty.blend /tmp/frosty
   cd /tmp/frosty
   nohup nice /opt/blender-2.93/blender -b frosty.blend -a
</pre>

<p class=np>You can then simply close the terminal window that you are working in.
The <i>nohup</i> means that closing the window and logging out will not also kill the process that is
running the command.  The <i>nice</i> means that the process will only run while the
computer has nothing else to do.  The rest of the line is the command for rendering
the animation that is set up in the file <i>frosty.blend</i>.</p>

<p>You can use the <i>top</i> command in a terminal window to check that Blender is
still running.  You should see blender at the top of the list of processes most
of the time, if it is rendering the animation.</p>
