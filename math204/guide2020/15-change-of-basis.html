<h2>15 Change of Basis</h2>
<hr>

<p>We have seen how to use <a href="13-matrices-and-linear-maps.html">matrices</a>
to <a href="14-representing-homomorphisms.html">represent&nbsp;homomorphisms</a>.
Those representations depend on choice of basis for each of the vector spaces
involved.  The question is, what happens when we change to a different basis?
Chapter Three, Section&nbsp;V of the textbook deals with this question.
</p>

<p>First, we look at the effect of change of basis on vectors.  Suppose that
$V$ is a vector space of dimension $n$, and we have two different bases for
$V$, $B=\langle\vec\beta_1,\vec\beta_2,\dots,\vec\beta_n\rangle$
and $D=\langle\vec\delta_1,\vec\delta_2,\dots,\vec\delta_n\rangle$.
We can then represent a vector $\vec v\in V$ as a column vector in $\R^n$
in two different ways, as ${\rm Rep}_B(\vec v)$ or as ${\rm Rep}_D(\vec v)$.
Given one of these representations, how can we get the other one?  This is
what it means to ask what happens to the representation when we change
our choice of basis.</p>

<p>Remember that ${\rm Rep}_B$ is an isomorphism ${\rm Rep}_B\colon V\to \R^n$,
and so is  ${\rm Rep}_D\colon V\to \R^n$.  And in each case we have the
inverse isomorphism ${\rm Rep}_B^{-1}$ or ${\rm Rep}_D^{-1}$.
We can transform ${\rm Rep}_B(\vec v)$, the representation of $\vec v$ in
the basis $B$, to ${\rm Rep}_D(\vec v)$, the representation of $\vec v$ in
the basis $D$, by applying the isomorphism ${\rm Rep}_D\circ{\rm Rep}_B^{-1}$
to it: $${\rm Rep}_D(\vec v) = {\rm Rep}_D\circ{\rm Rep}_B^{-1}({\rm Rep}_B(\vec v))$$
The homomorphism ${\rm Rep}_D\circ{\rm Rep}_B^{-1}$ maps $\R^n$ to $\R^n$,
and it has an $n\times n$ representation matrix, $Q$.  That is, for $\vec x\in \R^n$,
multiplication of $\vec x$ on the left by $Q$ is the same as applying the
isomorphism ${\rm Rep}_D\circ{\rm Rep}_B^{-1}$ to $\vec x$.  This matrix $Q$
is the <span class=nw>change of basis matrix</span> representing the change of
basis for $V$ from $B$ to $D$.  To be more clear, suppose that
$${\rm Rep}_B(\vec v) = \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}
\mbox{ and } {\rm Rep}_D(\vec v) = \begin{pmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\\vdots\\y_n\end{pmatrix}$$
Then, $$ Q\cdot \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\\vdots\\y_n\end{pmatrix}$$
Knowing $Q$, we can translate a vector from one representation to the other.
Note, by the way that the inverse matrix $Q^{-1}$ is the change of basis
matrix representing the change of basis in the other direction, from $D$ to $B$.</p>

<p>We still need a way to find $Q$, given $B$ and $D$.  This can be related back
to representations of general homomorphisms by writing
${\rm Rep}_D\circ{\rm Rep}_B^{-1}={\rm Rep}_D\circ id\circ{\rm Rep}_B^{-1}$
where $id\colon V\to V$ is the identity map $id(\vec v) = \vec v$.  We
then have the commutative diagram</p>

<p class=nw style="text-align:center"><img src="figures/fig15-1.png" width="405" height="213"></p>

<p class=np>We see that $Q$, the matrix that represents ${\rm Rep}_D\circ{\rm Rep}_B^{-1}$,
is what we defined as ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(id)$.  To find $Q$, we only need to write out
$id(\vec\beta_i)$ in terms of the basis $D$ for each $\vec\beta_i$ in $B$.
Since $id(\vec\beta_i)=\vec\beta_i$, this means we should write $\vec\beta_i$ as
a linear combination of $\delta$'s, and use the coefficients from that linear
combination as the $i^{\rm th}$ column of $Q$.  If
$$\begin{align*}
  \vec\beta_1 &= c_{11}\vec\delta_1 + c_{21}\vec\delta_2+ \cdots + c_{n1}\vec\delta_n\\
  \vec\beta_2 &= c_{21}\vec\delta_1 + c_{22}\vec\delta_2+ \cdots + c_{n2}\vec\delta_n\\
  &\vdots\\
  \vec\beta_n &= c_{1n}\vec\delta_1 + c_{2n}\vec\delta_2+ \cdots + c_{nn}\vec\delta_n
\end{align*}$$
then
$$ Q=\begin{pmatrix}
   c_{11} & c_{12} & \cdots & c_{1n}\\
   c_{21} & c_{22} & \cdots & c_{2n}\\
    \vdots& \vdots& \ddots & \vdots\\
   c_{n1} & c_{n2} & \cdots & c_{nn}
\end{pmatrix}$$

<p>Now, suppose that we have a homomorphism $h\colon V\to W$.
If $B$ is a basis for $V$ and $D$ is a basis for $W$, then we get the
representation matrix ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(h)$.  This representation depends both on
the choice of basis for $V$ and on the choice of basis for $W$.  How does the
representation of the homomorphism change if we choose different bases for
$V$ and for $W$?  That is, how can we get ${\rm Rep}_{B',D'}(h)$
from ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(h)$?</p>

<p>Suppose that we have alternative bases $B'$ and $D'$ of $V$ and $W$.
Let $Q={\rm Rep}_{B,B'}(id)$, the change of basis matrix representing the change of basis
for $V$ from $B$ to $B'$.  This matrix can be calculated from $B$ and $B'$ as above.
Similarly, let $P={\rm Rep}_{D,D'}(id)$, the change of basis matrix representing the change of basis
for $W$ from $D$ to $D'$. Then
$${\rm Rep}_{B',D'}(h) = P\cdot {\rm Rep}_{B,D}(h) \cdot Q^{-1}$$
This is simply writing the matrix ${\rm Rep}_{B',D'}(h)$ as a product of three
other matrices.</p>

<p>Remember that $Q^{-1}$ is the change of basis matrix from $B'$ to $B$.
If we start with a vector $\vec x\in \R^n$ that represents some $\vec v\in V$
in the basis $B'$, then $Q^{-1}\vec x$ is the element of $\R^n$ that represents $\vec v$
in the basis $B$.  By definition of ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(h)$, when we multiply
that vector by the matrix ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(h)$, we get the representation of $h(\vec v)$
in the basis $D$.  Finally, multiplying the result by $P$ gives the representation
of $h(\vec v)$ in the basis $D'$.  The final result, going from the representation of 
$\vec v$ in the basis $B'$ to the representation of $h(\vec v)$ in the basis $D'$
is exactly what the matrix ${\rm Rep}_{B',D'}(h)$ accomplishes.
