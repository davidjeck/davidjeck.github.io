<h2>07 Accuracy of Computation</h2>
<hr>

<p>"Accuracy of Computations" is one of the topics at the end of
Chapter&nbsp;1.  We will spend just a little time on this topic,
because it is an issue for almost any practical application of
numerical computation&mdash;and not just in linear algebra.
You won't really need anything from this topic in the rest of
this course, but I feel that you should be aware of the issue.
</p>

<p>When computations are done with real numbers on a computer,
only a limited number of decimal places are used.  This means
that real numbers, which can have an infinite number of digits
after the decimal point, are represented only approximately.</p>

<p>And the problem is not just one of computation with a finite
number of decimal places instead of an infinite number.  In practice,
the problem of <i>measurement</i> is often more important.
When the inputs to a computation come from physical or statistical
measurements, the input is generally only accurate to a certain 
number of digits, often a small number.
There is a built-in error that is not going
to be fixed by using more decimal places.</p>

<p>Most often, computations are done with some fixed number of 
digits of accuracy, say 8 or 15.  This has some funny consequences.
For example, addition and multiplication are no longer strictly
associative; the order of computation matters.  For example, 1.0/3.0
with 8 digit accuracy becomes 0.33333333.  This means that
$3.0*(1.0/3.0)=3.0*0.33333333=0.99999999$ while
$(3.0*1.0)/3.0 = 3.0/3.0 = 1.0$.  This small discrepancy might not
seem like a big deal, but suppose $A=1.0$ and $B=3.0$, and
we need to compute $\frac{1.0}{1.0-3.0*A/B}$.  If this is
computed a $\frac{1.0}{1.0-3.0*(A/B)}$, the answer is $\frac{1.0}{0.00000001}$
or 100000000.  But if it is computed as $\frac{1.0}{1.0-(3.0*A)/B}$,
then the denominator is zero and the answer is undefined (or infinite).</p>

<p>More important for us is the fact that a small inaccuracy in the inputs
to a computation can result in a larger inaccuracy in the output of that
computation.  As a simple example, if quantities $A$ and $B$ can be wrong
by some small amount $\eps$, then $A+B$ could be off by as much as $2\eps$.
When a lot of computations are done to produce the output,
a small error in the inputs can result in a large error in the outputs.
This is why, to really understand what the result of a computation means,
you sometimes need to do an error analysis as well as the
actual computation.  There is a whole field of mathematics called <span class=nw>numerical
analysis</span> that studies this issue, and it is certainly not an easy field.</p>


<p>Here is a linear algebra example.  Consider a system of two equations
$2.01x+3.00y=5.00$ and $3.99x + 6.00y = 10.00$, and suppose that there
are possible errors of up to 0.01 in each of the coefficients.  Then
that actual system could be, for example, any of the following
$$\matrix{2.01x+3.00y=5.00\cr 3.99x + 6.00y = 10.00}\qquad
  \matrix{2.00x+3.00y=5.00\cr 4.00x + 6.00y = 10.00}\qquad
  \matrix{2.00x+3.00y=5.00\cr 4.00x + 6.00y = 9.99}$$
The first of these systems has a unique solution, the second has infinitely
may solutions, and the third has no solution.  So we can't even be
certain of the most basic fact about this system!</p>

<p>Computations done with integers and rational numbers are perfectly accurate,
which is one reason why they are just about the only kinds of number that you
will see in this course.  However, restricting yourself to rational numbers does
not solve the problem of errors in measurement&mdash;and it can quickly lead to
some really intimidating fractions!</p>
