<h2>14 Representing General Homomorphisms</h2>
<hr>

<p>We have looked at how <a href="13-matrices-and-linear-maps.html">matrices represent linear maps</a>
from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$.  We now turn to the idea of using matrices to represent arbitrary linear
maps between finite-dimensional vector spaces.  The representation of a homomorphism $h\colon V\to W$
depends on a choice of bases for $V$ and $W$; different bases give different representations.
This is true even if the vector spaces in question are of the form $\R^n$.  What we have looked
at previously was the representation of homomorphisms from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$ with respect to the
standard bases of $\R^n$ and $\R^n$, something that we will now denote
${\rm Rep}_{E_n,E_m}(h)$.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span>
Suppose that $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces and $h\colon V\to W$ is
a homomorphism from $V$ to $W$.  Let $B=\langle \vec\beta_1,\vec\beta_2,\dots,\vec\beta_n \rangle$
be a basis of $V$ and let $D=\langle \vec\delta_1,\vec\delta_2,\dots,\vec\delta_m \rangle$
be a basis of $W$.  We define ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(h)$, the <span class=nw>representation of $h$
with respect to the bases $B$ and $D$</span>, to be the $n\times m$ matrix whose entries, $c_{ij}$
are defined by $$h(\vec\beta_i) = c_{1i}\vec\delta_1 + c_{2i}\vec\delta_2 + \cdots + c_{mi}\vec\delta_m$$
for $i=1,2,\dots,n$.  That is, the $i^{\rm th}$ column of ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(h)$ contains the
coefficients in the linear combination that represents $h(\vec\beta_i)$
in the basis $D$.
</p></div>

<p>Consider the case of a homomorphism $f\colon \R^n\to\R^m$, and the standard bases
$E_n=\langle \vec e_1,\vec e_2,\dots,\vec e_n \rangle$ and
$E_m=\langle \vec e_1,\vec e_2,\dots,\vec e_m \rangle$.
Then ${\rm Rep}_{E_n,E_m}(f)$ is obtained by writing
$$f(\vec e_i)= c_{1i}\vec e_1 + c_{2i}\vec e_2 + \cdots + c_{mi}\vec e_m$$
and using the coefficients $c_{ij}$ as the entries in the matrix.
But $c_{1i}\vec e_1 + c_{2i}\vec e_2 + \cdots + c_{mi}\vec e_m$ is just
the column vector $\begin{pmatrix}c_{1i}\\c_{2i}\\\vdots\\c_{mi}\end{pmatrix}$,
so ${\rm Rep}_{E_n,E_m}(f)$ is simply the matrix whose $i^{\rm th}$ column
is $h(\vec e_i)$ written as a column vector in the usual way.
This is the same matrix that we have associated previously with $f$.</p>


<p>To understand why this representation for general homomorphisms is useful,
we need to review an earlier idea: representing a vector with respect to a basis.
Suppose that $B=\langle\vec\beta_1,\vec\beta_2,\dots\vec\beta_n\rangle$ is a basis
for a vector space $V$. For $\vec v\in V$, we defined
$${\rm Rep}_B(\vec v) =
\begin{pmatrix} c_1\\ c_2\\ \vdots\\ c_n\end{pmatrix}$$
where $\vec v$ is written in the basis $B$ as $\vec v=c_1\vec\beta_1+c_2\vec\beta_2+\cdots+c_n\vec\beta_n$.
We can now see that ${\rm Rep}_B$ is a function ${\rm Rep_B}\colon V\to \R^n$ and that
it is in fact an isomorphism of $V$ with $\R^n$. 
Note that we also have the inverse isomorphism ${\rm Rep}_B^{-1}\colon\R^n\to V$.
</p>

<p>Now, suppose that we have a homomorphism $f\colon V\to W$, a basis 
$B=\langle \vec\beta_1,\vec\beta_2,\dots,\vec\beta_n \rangle$ of $V$ and
a basis $D=\langle \vec\delta_1,\vec\delta_2,\dots,\vec\delta_m \rangle$ of $W$.
We get a homomorphism from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$ by starting in
$\R^n$, applying ${\rm Rep}_B^{-1}$ to get from $\R^n$ to $V$, then
applying $f$ to get from $V$ to $W$, and finally applying 
${\rm Rep}_D$ to get from $W$ to $\R^m$.  This process is illustrated in
this <span class=nw>commutative diagram</span>:</p>

<p class=np style="text-align:center"><img src="figures/fig14-1.png" width=310 height=175></p>

<p class=np>If $f(\vec\beta_i)=c_{1i}\vec\delta_1 + c_{2i}\vec\delta_2 + \cdots + c_{mi}\vec\delta_m$,
then $$\begin{align*}
{\rm Rep}_D\circ f\circ {\rm Rep}_B(\vec e_i)
           &amp;= {\rm Rep}_D\circ f(\vec\beta_i)\\
           &amp;= {\rm Rep}_D(c_{1i}\vec\delta_1 + c_{2i}\vec\delta_2 + \cdots + c_{mi}\vec\delta_m)\\
           &amp;= c_{i1}{\rm Rep}_D(\vec\delta_1) + c_{i2}{\rm Rep}_D(\vec\delta_2) + \cdots c_{im}{\rm Rep}_D(\vec\delta_m)\\
           &amp;= c_{i1}\vec e_1 + c_{i2}\vec e_2 + \cdots c_{im}\vec e_m
\end{align*}$$
That is, ${\rm Rep}_D\circ f\circ {\rm Rep}_B$ is the homomorphism from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$
whose matrix is ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(f)$ (in the standard bases).</p>

<p>The basic idea here is that choosing bases for $V$ and $W$ makes them "look like"
$\R^n$ and $\R^m$, and in that representation, a homomorphism $f\colon V\to W$
corresponds to a homomorphism from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$.  That homomorphism from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$
is given, in the usual way, as multiplication by some $m\times n$ matrix, and that
matrix is what we call ${\rm Rep}_{B,D}(f)$.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that if we choose <b>non-standard</b> bases $B$ and $D$ for $\R^n$ and
$\R^m$, we get representation maps ${\rm Rep}_B\colon \R^n\to\R^n$ and ${\rm Rep}_D\colon \R^m\to\R^m$
and those representations give alternative matrix representations for homomorphisms from $\R^n$ to
$\R^m$.  Our usual matrix representations for such maps are tied specifically to the
standard bases of $\R^n$ and $\R^m$.</p>
