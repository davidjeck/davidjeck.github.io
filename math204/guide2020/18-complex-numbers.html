<h2>18 Complex Numbers and Complex Vector Spaces</h2>
<hr>

<p>So far in this course, we have only looked at vectors spaces "over $\R$,"
also called "real vector spaces."  In the definition of a vector space over $\R$,
the scalars are real numbers.  The standard $n$-dimensional vectors space is $\R^n$.
Linear maps are represented by matrices of real numbers.
</p>

<p>However, the real numbers are just one example of a "field."  A field
is a certain kind of algebraic structure.  There are other fields besides
$\R$, and any field can be used in the definition of vector space in place
of $\R$.  In particular, we will need to use $\C$, the field of complex numbers,
and vectors spaces over $\C$.  The definition of field pretty much just
says that addition and multiplication in the field have all the familiar
properties of addition and multiplication of real numbers.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span>
A <span class=nw>field</span>, $\def\F{{\mathbb F}} (\F,+,\cdot)$, consists
of a set $\F$ and two binary operators, $+$ and $\cdot$, on $\F$ satisfying
<ol>
<li>Closure under addition: for all $a,b\in\F$, $a+b\in\F$.</li>
<li>Addition is commutative: for all $a,b\in\F$, $a+b = b+a$.</li>
<li>Addition is associative: for all $a,b\in\F$, $a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c$.</li>
<li>Additive identity: there exists $0\in\F$ such that $0\cdot a = 0$ for all $a\in\F$.</li>
<li>Additive inverses: for every $a\in\F$, there exists $-a\in\F$ such that $a+(-a)=0$.</li>
<li>Closure under multiplication: for all $a,b\in\F$, $a\cdot b\in\F$.</li>
<li>Multiplication is commutative: for all $a,b\in\F$, $a\cdot b = b\cdot a$.</li>
<li>Multiplication is associative: for all $a,b\in\F$, $a\cdot (b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c$.</li>
<li>Multiplicative identity: there exists $1\in\F$ such that $1\cdot a = a$ for all $a\in\F$.</li>
<li>Multiplicative inverses: for any $a\in\F$, if $a\ne0$, there exists $a^{-1}\in\F$ such that $a\cdot a^{-1}=1$.</li>
<li>Multiplication distributes over addition:  for all $a,b,c\in\F$, $c\cdot(a+b) = (c\cdot a) + (c\cdot b)$.
<li>$1\ne 0$.
</ol>
</div>

<p>The set $\Q$ of rational numbers is a field that is a subset of $\R$.  $\Q$ is a <span class=nw>subfield</span>
of $\R$ becasue it uses the addition and multiplication operations that it inherits from $\R$.
$\R$ actually has many other subfields, such as $\{a+b\sqrt{2}\,|\,a,b\in\Q\}$.
There are even finite fields.  For example the set $\Z_p=\{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}$, where $p$ is any prime
number, becomes a field if addition and multiplication are defined "mod&nbsp;p".  (This just means that in $\Z_p$,
$a$ plus $b$ means the remainder when the usual $a+b$ is divided by $p$, and similarly for $a$ times $b$.)
However, the only field that we will actually use is the field of complex numbers.</p>

<p>A <span class=nw>complex number</span> can be written in the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
and $i$ is used to represent the constant $\sqrt{-1}$.  A real number $a$ is also a complex number since
it can be written in the form $a+0\cdot i$.  So $\R$ is a subset of $\C$.  But to make $\C$ into a field,
we have to define addition and multiplication of complex numbers.  This is done as follows:
$$\begin{align*}
   (a+bi) + (c+di) &= (a+b)+(c+d)i\\[6pt]
   (a+bi)\cdot(c+di) &= ac + adi + bci + bdi^2\\
      &= ac + adi + bci - bd\\
      &= (ac - bd) + (ad+bc)i
\end{align*}$$
It can be shown that with these definitions, $(\C,+,\cdot)$ is a field.  The multiplicative
inverse of a non-zero complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\frac{1}{a+bi} =
\frac{a}{a^2+b^2} - \frac{b}{a^2+b^2}i$.  More generally, we can compute a quotient
as $$
\frac{a+bi}{c+di} = \frac{a+bi}{c+di}\cdot\frac{c-di}{c-di}
   = \frac{(a+bi)(c-di)}{c^2+d^2} = \frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2} + \frac{ad-bc}{c^2+d^2}i
$$
</p>

<p>The complex number $a+bi$ can be visualized as the point $(a,b)$ in the plane.
The <span class=nw>complex plane</span> consists of all the complex numbers, visualized
in this way.  The horizontal axis of the plane represents the real numbers and
is called the real axis.  The vertical axis consists of all multiples of $i$ and
is called the imaginary axis.  Note that this identifies $\C$ with $\R^2$, and in fact
$\C$ can be considered to be a real vector space of dimension two, with
scalar multiplication $r\cdot(a+bi) = ra + rbi$ for $r\in\R$.</p>

<p>If $z=a+bi$ is a complex number, then the <span class=nw>norm</span> (or length or 
absolute value) of $z$ is defined to be $|z| = |a+bi| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.  Note that
the norm is a non-negative real number.  The <span class=nw>conjugate</span> of $z$
is defined to be $\overline{z} = \overline{a+bi} = a-bi$.
Note that $z\in\R$ if and only if $z=\overline{z}$.  Also,
$|z|^2 = z\cdot\overline{z}$.</p>

<p>Recall that it is possible for a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree two or higher, 
with real coefficients, to have no roots.  That is, the equation $p(x)=0$ might
have no solutions.  The simplest example is $p(x)=x^2+1$.  There is no real
number $x$ such that $x^2+1=0$.  However, the complex numbers $i$ and $-i$ are
complex roots of this equation.  Note that $x^2+1$ cannot be factored if we
only have real numbers to work with. We say that $x^2+1$ is "irreducible over
the real numbers."  But if we are using complex numbers,
we can factor $x^2+1=(x-i)(x+i)$.  One of the most important and surprising 
facts about complex numbers &mdash; and the main reason why we need them 
in this course &mdash; is the following theorem:</p>

<div class=thm><p><span class=dtp>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:</span>
Any non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has a root in the
complex numbers.  Any complex polynomial of degree $n>0$ factors
into a product of $n$ linear factors.</p></div>

<hr class=break>

<p>To define vector spaces over a field $\F$, we can use exactly the same
definition as for vector spaces over $\R$, except that scalars are elements
of $\F$ instead of elements of $\R$.  We will only be interested in
vector spaces over $\C$, which are also called <span class=nw>complex vector spaces</span>.
Almost everything that we did with real vector spaces could have been done
with complex vector spaces.  The only exception is things involving inner
product (including length, orthogonality, and angles), which has to
be defined differently for complex column vectors).
</p>

<p>Thus, we define column vectors, row vectors, matrices, row operations, echelon form, 
linear combinations, matrices, matrix multiplication, homomorphisms, and determinants
using complex numbers instead of real numbers.</p>

<p>The standard $n$-dimensional vector space is $\C^n$, the vector space of
column vectors where the entries can be complex numbers.  The standard
basis for $\C^n$ is the same as the standard basis for $\R^n$, $E_n=\langle
\vec e_1,\vec e_2,\dots,\vec e_n\rangle$.  Any $n$-dimensional
complex vector space is isomorphic to $\C^n$.  We can redefine
$\mathscr P_n$ to be the complex vector space of polynomials with
complex coefficients and degree less than or equal to $n$, and we
then have that $\mathscr P_n$ is isomorphic to $\C^{n+1}$.
Similarly, $M_{m\times n}$ now represents $m\times n$ matrices with
complex entries, a complex vector space of dimension $mn$.
Any $m\times n$ matrix $A$ of complex numbers defines a homomorphism
from $\C^n$ to $\C^m$ by sending $\vec v$ to $A\vec v$.</p>

<p>Note that the determinant of an $n\times n$ complex matrix
will be a complex number.  It is still true that the determinant
is zero if and only if the matrix is singular.</p>

<p>In short, nothing much changes except that multiplication
and division become harder.  The reason for making the change
from real to complex vector spaces will become clear as we
study eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p>
