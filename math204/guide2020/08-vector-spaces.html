<h2>08 Vector Spaces</h2>
<hr>

<p>We have been thinking of a "vector" as being a column, or sometimes a row, of numbers.
These are "vectors in $\R^n$."
In Chapter 2, we move to a more abstract view, where a vector is simply an element of
something called a "vector space."  The discussion will become
more abstract and more theoretical, and there will be more proofs.  However, in the
end, most of the practical work is still done using matrices and columns of numbers, and
you should still tend to visualize vectors as arrows in $\R^2$ or $\R^3$ when you
what to get a more intuitive understanding of what is going on.</p>

<div class=def id=vec><p><span class=dtp>Definition:</span>
A <span class=nw>vector space</span> $(V,+,\cdot)$ over $\R$ is defined to be a set, $V$, together
with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$, which are called vector addition and scalar
multiplication.  <span class=nw>Binary operation</span>  means that the operator
takes two inputs and produces some output.  Vector addition takes two elements of $V$ as input.
Scalar multiplication takes a scalar, that is a
real number, and an element of $V$ as input.  Vector addition
and scalar multiplication must satisfy ten properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>$\vec v+\vec u\in V$ for all $\vec v,\vec u\in V$ (<span class=nw>closure</span> under vector addition)</li>
<li>$\vec v+\vec u=\vec u+\vec v$ for all $\vec v,\vec u\in V$ (vector addition is <span class="nw">commutative</span>)</li>
<li>$\vec v+(\vec u+\vec w)=(\vec u+\vec v)+\vec w$ for all $\vec v,\vec u,\vec w\in V$  (vector addition is <span class="nw">associative</span>)</li>
<li>there is a $\vec 0\in V$ such that $\vec v + \vec 0 = \vec v$ for all $\vec v\in V$ (<span class=nw>additive identity</span>)</li>
<li>for any $\vec v\in V$, there is $-\vec v\in V$ such that $\vec v + (-\vec v)=\vec 0$ (<span class=nw>additive inverse</span>)</li>
<li>$r\cdot\vec v \in V$ for all $r\in\R$ and $\vec v\in V$ (<span class=nw>closure</span> under scalar multiplication)</li>
<li>$(r+s)\cdot \vec v = (r\cdot \vec v) + (s\cdot\vec v)$ for all $r,s\in\R$ and $\vec v\in V$ (first <span class=nw>distributive</span> property)</li>
<li>$r\cdot(\vec v +\vec u) = (r\cdot\vec v)+(r\cdot\vec u)$ for all $r\in\R$ and $\vec v,\vec u\in V$ (second <span class=nw>distributive</span> property)</li>
<li>$(rs)\cdot\vec v = r\cdot (s\cdot\vec v)$ for all $r,s\in\R$ and $\vec v\in V$ (second <span class=nw>associative</span> property)</li>
<li>$1\cdot\vec v = \vec v$ for all $\vec v\in V$ (<span class=nw>multiplicative identity</span>)</li>
</ol>

<p class=np>These properties are all things that you already know are true, or that are
obvious, for the usual column vectors in $\R^n$.  You certainly don't have to remember the
number for each property, but you should know that they are true for any vector space, 
and you should be ready to pull them out when you need them in a proof or calculation.</p>

<p>The vector space $\R^n$ of column vectors is still our most basic and important example.
We will see that in some sense, any so-called "finite dimensional" vector space is 
really the same as $\R^n.$  The technical term is that it is <span class=nw>isomorphic</span>
to $\R^n$ as a vector space.  There are also "infinite dimensional" vector spaces, but we
will mostly avoid them except for some examples.</p>

<p>Chapter One, Section 1.I works through many examples of vector spaces, and you should
pay attention to them.  The most important, since we will often use them in future examples,
are $\mathcal P_n$, for $n\in \N$, and the vector space that I will call $\mathcal F$:<p>

<p>$\mathcal P_n$ is the set of polynomials with real coefficients and degree less than
or equal to $n$.  Vector addition in this vector space is the usual addition of
polynomials and scalar multiplication is the usual multiplication of a polynomial
by a constant.  That is,</p>

<ul>
<li>$\mathcal P_n=\{a_o+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_nx^n\,|\,a_o,a_1,\dots,a_n\in\R\}$</li>
<li>$(a_o+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_nx^n) + (b_o+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots+b_nx^n)$ =<br> 
         <span style="margin-left:120pt">$(a_o+b_o)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^2+\cdots+(a_n+b_n)x^n$</span></li>
<li>$r\cdot(a_o+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_nx^n) = (ra_o)+(ra_1)x+(ra_2)x^2+\cdots+(ra_n)x^n$</li>
</ul>

<p class=np>We also consider the space $\mathcal P$ of all polynomials, of any degree.
The vector space $\mathcal P$ is an example of an infinite-dimensional vector space.</p>

<p>$\mathscr F$ is the set of real-valued functions of a real variable, with
the usual addition of functions and the usual multiplication of a scalar times a function.
That is,</p>

<ul>
<li>$\mathscr F = \{ f\,|\, f:\R\to\R\}$</li>
<li>$f+g$ is defined by $(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$ for all $x\in\R$</li>
<li>$r\cdot f$ is defined by $(r\cdot f)(x) = r(f(x))$ for all $x\in\R$</li>
</ul>

<p class=np>$\mathscr F$ is an example of a <span class=nw>function space</span>.  There are
many other function spaces.  For example, $\mathscr C$, the vector space of continuous
functions, or $\mathscr D$, the vector space of differentiable functions.  Function spaces
such as these are among the most important vector spaces in some branches of mathematics.  We could
also look at real-valued functions defined on other sets.  The book uses the
set of functions from $\N$ to $\R$ as an example.  The set of functions on the closed
interval $[a,b]$ would be another example.  In all of these cases, vector addition
and scalar multiplication are defined in the same way.</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>The ten properties that are listed in the definition of vector space are not the only
properties that are true for all vector spaces.  But they represent a set of 
<span class=nw>axioms</span> for vector spaces.  The axioms are <i>assumed</i> to
be true of all vector spaces.  They can be used to <i>prove</i> other facts about
vector spaces.</p>

<p>For example, it is not assumed that $0\cdot \vec v=\vec 0$ for all vectors $\vec v$,
but it can be proved using only the axioms and facts about real numbers:
$$\begin{align*}
   0\cdot\vec v &=(0+0)\cdot \vec v&\mbox{(property of $0\in\R$)}\\
   0\cdot\vec v &=(0\cdot \vec v)+(0\cdot \vec v)&\mbox{(distributive law)}
  \end{align*}$$
By the additive inverse property, $0\cdot\vec v$ has an additive inverse $-(0\cdot\vec v)$.
Add it to both sides of the above equation:
$$\begin{align*}
    0\cdot\vec v + (-(0\cdot\vec v))&=((0\cdot \vec v)+(0\cdot \vec v)) +(-(0\cdot\vec v))\\
    0\cdot\vec v + (-(0\cdot\vec v))&=(0\cdot \vec v)+((0\cdot \vec v) +(-(0\cdot\vec v)))&\mbox{(associative law)}\\
    \vec 0 &=(0\cdot \vec v)+\vec 0 &\mbox{(additive inverse)}\\
    \vec 0 &=0\cdot \vec v &\mbox{(additive identity)}
\end{align*}$$</p>

<hr class=break>

<p>The definition of vectors space refers to a vector space "over $\R$".  This means that
scalars are real numbers.  In fact, vector spaces can be defined over other
kinds of scalars.  The restriction is that the set of scalars, together with
addition and multiplication of scalars, must be a <span class=nw>field</span>.
For example, the rational numbers, $\mathbb Q$, form a field, where two rational numbers are
added or multiplied in the same way they are added and multiplied as real
numbers.  This means that we could define vector spaces "over $\mathbb Q$".
The complex numbers, $\C$, also form a field.  In fact, the last
chapter in the textbook uses vector spaces over $\C.$  However, until we
get to that chapter, all of our vector spaces will be vector spaces
over $\R.$</p>
