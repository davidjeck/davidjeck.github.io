<h2>11 Matrix Rank</h2>
<hr>

<p>Section III.3 in Chapter Two is principally about the <span class=nw>rank</span>
of a matrix.  It begins by discussing row rank and column rank separately but
ultimately shows that the row rank and column rank are the same.  The rank
of a matrix is defined to be the common value of its row rank and column rank.</p>

<div class=def><p><span class=dtp>Definition.</span> The <span class=nw>row space</span>
of an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is defined to be the subspace of $\R^n$ spanned by the
rows of $A$.  The <span class=nw>row rank</span> of $A$ is the dimension of that
subspace. The <span class=nw>column space</span>
of an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is defined to be the subspace of $\R^m$ spanned by the
columns of $A$.  The <span class=nw>column rank</span> of $A$ is the dimension of that
subspace.</p></div>

<p>It is not hard to see that the row space is not changed by applying a row operation
to a matrix.  This means that row-equivalent matrices have the same row space and
the same row rank.  That rank can be determined by putting the matrix into reduced
echelon form, which will have the same row rank as the original matrix since
it is row-equivalent to the original matrix.
The row rank of a reduced echelon form matrix is just the number of non-zero rows
in the matrix or, equivalently, the number of leading variables.  This is true
since the non-zero rows are linearly independent and so form a basis for the
row space.</p>

<p>When a row operation is applied to a matrix, the column space can change.  However,
the column rank remains the same.  This means that row-equivalent matrices have the
same column rank, and to find the column rank, you can put the matrix into reduced
echelon form and check the column rank.  But the column rank of a reduced echelon
form matrix is just the number of leading variables, since the columns that
contain leading entries are linearly independent (they are in fact vectors in the
standard basis $\langle\vec e_1,\vec e_2,\dots,\vec e_n\rangle$), and the other
columns are linear combinations of the columns that contain leading entries.</p>

<p>Since the number of leading variables in the reduced echelon form of the
matrix represents both the row rank and column rank of the original matrix,
we see that the row rank and column rank are indeed the same.</p>

<p>If the $m\times n$ matrix $A$ has rank $r$, then the number of leading variables
is $r$ and the number of free variables is $n-r$.  Note that the number of free variables
is the dimension of the space of solutions of the homogeneous system corresponding to
the matrix.</p>
