<h1 class="head">Free On-Line Java Text</h1>

<p>The first programming course at Hobart and William Smith Colleges
covers the Java programming language.  Since we started teaching Java
in 1996, the textbook for the course has been various versions
of a free on-line Java textbook that I wrote for the course.
The most recent version, Version&nbsp;9, was released in May 2022.
It requires Java&nbsp;17 or later, 
and it comes in two editions, one using JavaFX  for GUI programming and
one using Swing.  The two editions can be found at</p>

<p  style="margin-left:60px">JavaFX Edition: <a href="https://davidjeck.github.io/javanotes/">https://davidjeck.github.io/javanotes/</a></p>

<p  style="margin-left:60px">Swing Edition: <a href="https://davidjeck.github.io/javanotes-swing/">https://davidjeck.github.io/javanotes-swing/</a></p>

<p>Older versions of the book are also available; see the
<a href="cs124/javanotes9/preface.html">Preface</a>
for links.</p>

<p>The textbook is an introduction to programming and also an introduction to Java 
directed towards people who do not have any background in programming.
You can use it on-line or download a copy for use on your own computer.
PDF and print versions are also available. Links can be found at the bottoms of the 
web pages linked above.</p>

<h1 class="head">Free Computer Graphics Textbook</h1>

<p>An introductory computer graphics textbook, available for use on-line.
There are also links on the front page for downloading the web-site version or a PDF version.
This book was used in my 
<a href="cs424/index.html">Computer&nbsp;Graphics&nbsp;course</a> in Fall 2015,  Fall 2017,
and Fall 2021. Version 1.4 is new in August 2023; it adds a new chapter on WebGPU.</p>

<p>The prerequisite for the book is two semesters of computer programming in Java, C/C++, or JavaScript,
including a basic knowledge of data structures, objects, and object-oriented programming.  It covers
core concepts from 2D graphics in Java, JavaScript, and SVG; 3D graphics with old-fashioned OpenGL 1.1; the three.js
JavaScript library for 3D Web graphics; WebGL, the version of OpenGL for the Web; and WebGPU, a
newer API for Web graphics.
There is an appendix with short introductions to the essential features of Java, C, and JavaScript.
See the <a href="cs424/graphicsbook-1.4/preface.html">Preface</a> for more information.
The book is available at</p>

<h1 class="head">Some Web Apps, written in JavaScript</h1>

<p>For many years, I wrote small web applications as Java applets.  However, applets
are no longer supported in  web
browsers.  A more modern alternative to Java Applets is to write web applications in
JavaScript, which is well-supported in all modern browsers.  (Note that Java and JavaScript
are completely different languages, in spite of the names.)   One of my projects for my sabbatical
leave in Spring 2016 was to learn JavaScript better and to write some JavaScript Web apps.
So far, I have ported some of my examples from Java to JavaScript, and added a few new apps
that were written originally in JavaScript.
The work that I have done so far is available on this page:</p> 

<p style="margin-left:1in"><a href="js/index.html">David Eck's JavaScript Page</a>

<p>Here are direct links to some of the more interesting examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="js/genetic-algorithm/GA.html">Genetic&nbsp;Algorithms&nbsp;Demo</a>:
   Demonstrates the Genetic Algorithm by showing how some simple simulated organisms evolve
   over a series of generations.</li>
<li><a href="js/mandelbrot/MB.html">Mandelbrot&nbsp;Viewer</a>:
   Explore the famous Mandelbrot set, and make some amazing pictures!</li>
<li><a href="js/pentominos/pentominos.html">Pentominos&nbsp;Puzzle&nbsp;Solver</a>:
   Solves pentominos puzzles, which involve placing twelve pieces
   of various shapes on a board.  Fun to watch.</li>
<li><a href="js/symmetry/wallpaper.html">Wallpaper&nbsp;Groups</a>:
   Draw symmetric patterns in the plane, where the symmetry is given by one of
   the seventeen wallpaper groups.</li>
<li><a href="js/sorting/xSortLab.html">xSortLab</a>:
   Learn about five sorting algorithms and compare their run times.</li> 
<li><a href="js/xLogicCircuits/xLogicCircuits.html">xLogicCircuits</a>:
   Construct simulated logic circuits with AND, OR, and NOT gates.</li>
<li><a href="js/turing-machine/TM.html">Turing Machine Simulation</a>: Create and run
    simulated Turing machines.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mandelbrot set, in particular, is amazing.  There is a large
<a href="js/mandelbrot/java/MandelbrotSettings/index.html">collection&nbsp;of&nbsp;images</a> that
are visualizations of pieces of that set.  
Click on any of the small images on that page to load that example into 
the Mandelbrot Viewer, where you can see a larger version of the image and
explore it further.</p>

<h1 class="head">Free CS Theory Textbook</h1>

<p>CPSC 229: <i>Foundations of Computer Science</i> is an
introductory course in theoretical computer science.  It is a required
course in the Computer Science major.  For several years, the textbook
in this course has been a set of notes written by Professor Carol
Critchlow and me.  This set of notes is now available for reading
on-line or for downloading, at no charge.  For more information and
links to the PDF version of the book, see:</p>

<h1 class="head">The Most Complex Machine</H1>

<p>My introductory computer science textbook, 
<cite><a href="TMCM/index.html">The Most Complex Machine</a>,</cite> 
was published in July, 1995.  This book is no longer in print, but I have
made a <a href="TMCM/TMCM.pdf">PDF</a> available for free download.
Although a lot of it is outdated, most of it is still valid and is
still relevant.
The book surveys several major areas of 
computer science, and was meant as a textbook for a first course in
computer science or for self-studt.    A review of in the
April '96 issue of <cite>CHOICE</cite> magazine says that it is
&quot;<span class="head">Strongly
recommended as a foundation for guided self-study for gifted high-school
students, as well as non-computing majors</span>.&quot;  You can read
more about it <a href="TMCM/index.html">here</a>.
</p>


<p>I wrote several small programs for use with the book.  The original programs
were for Macinstosh computers.  They were later translated to Java applets,
which are unfortunately no longer usable.  More recently, I have translated
all of the programs in to web apps, which are still useful on their own. See
