<h2>Java Programming on Your Computer</h2>

<p>If you want to use Java on your own Windows or Mac computer,
you will need to install some software.  Later in the semester, we
will start using a program called Eclipse for Java programming.
Eclipse is a GUI development system that includes everything that
you need to write, compile, and run basic Java programs (but you
will still need to download JavaFX to program GUI applications).
You might want to put off installing Java on your computer until 
we use Eclipse, or get someone to show you how to use it
early.</p>

<p>If you want to use Java on the command line, you will need
to install a JDK (Java Development Kit).  
You will need a plain
text editor.  And you will need to know how to use the
command line on your computer.  (All this stuff is free.)</p>

<p><a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s6.html">Section 2.6</a>
in the textbook has more detailed information about using Java on
your computer.  This web page has the basic information that you
need to get going.</p>

<h3>Installing OpenJDK</h3>

<p>I recommend installing OpenJDK 16 from <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">https://adoptopenjdk.net</a>.
Just go to that web site.  It should already be set to
download an installer for your operating system.  
Select "OpenJDK&nbsp;16&nbsp;(Latest)", and click the
download button (which says "Latest release".  This should download an installer for your
computer.  After running the installer, accepting all defaults, you should be set up to 
compile and run Java programs on the command line using the <i>javac</i> and
<i>java</i> commands.  (Note that OpenJDK&nbsp;11 and OpenJDK&nbsp;17, when it
comes out in September, would also be OK for this course.)</p>

<h3>Accessing the Command Line</h3>

<p>MacOS has a Terminal program that works almost identically to the Terminal
program in Linux, using the same set of commands.  You can find it in the "Utilities"
folder inside the Applications folder, or just search for it in Spotlight.
I suggest adding the Terminal icon permanently to the Dock.</p>

<p>On Windows, you can run a program called <i>cmd</i>.  Just open the Start menu and
type in the name to open it. (Alternatively, you could use PowerShell if you know about it.)
The available commands are a little different from Linux.  The <i>mkdir</i> and <i>cd</i>
commands are similar, but the command for listing the files in the current directory is
<i>dir</i> instead of <i>ls</i>.  There is no <i>pwd</i> command, but using the
<i>cd</i> command by itself, with no directory name, will print the path to the 
current directory.</p>

<p>Once you've managed to get to the command line, try the following commands
to make sure that Java is properly installed.</p>

<pre>
            java -version
   and
            javac -version
</pre>        

<p>These commands simply tell you which version of Java is installed.</p>

<h3>Getting a Text Editor</h3>

<p>You can use any editor that can save files in plain text format.  (Word processing
files are not usable since their files contain extra stuff besides the text of the document.)
The built-in <i>TextEdit</i> on Mac or <i>Notepad</i> on Windows will work, as long as
you make sure the file is saved as plain text.  But they are not really appropriate
for serious programming work.</p>

<p>For MacOS, I like the program <i>bbedit</i>, from <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/</a>.
It's a commercial program, but you can download and use it for free.  (You only have to
pay to enable advanced features that you really won't need.)</p>

<p>I don't know as much about windows, but <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> seems popular.  
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-ide/downloads/edit/">Komodo&nbsp;Edit</a>
is a cross platform editor that I have used a lot on Linux. (Download Komodo Edit, <b>not</b> the
IDE, which you have to register for.)</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Work</h3>

<p>Even though you are working on your own computer, you still need to submit your 
work to your homework folder on the Linux system.  MacOS and recent versions of Windows
both have the command <i>scp</i>, which can be used to copy files from one computer
to another.  For example, to copy a folder named <i>lab1</i> into your homework
submission folder, you would use a command similar to</p>

<pre>      scp  -r  lab1  <b>zz9999</b>@math.hws.edu:/classes/cs124/homework/<b>LastName</b></pre>

<p>This assumes that you are working in the directory that contains the lab1 directory.
Here, <b>zz9999</b> represents your user name, the one that you use to log into Linux.
And <b>LastName</b> is the name of your homework submission folder, which will be the
same as your last name.  The <i>math.hws.edu</i> is the name of a computer that has
access to our Linux system.  This command will work from anywhere in the world, not
just on campus.  After you give the command, you might first be asked to confirm
that you really want to connect; this will only happen the first time you try
to contact math.hws.edu.  You will be asked for your Linux password.</p>

<p>There are also GUI applications for copying files between computers.  If you
want to use one of those, you should select <i>sftp</i> protocol and use
<i>math.hws.edu</i> as the name of the computer, or "host", that you want
to connect to.</p>


<h3>JavaFX for GUI Applications</h3>

<p>We will start writing GUI programs early in the course, possibly as soon as the
second lab.  You should probably put off installing JavaFX on your own computer until we
get there.  But to use GUI programs, you will eventually need to download JavaFX from
<a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/">https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/</a></p>

<p>To use with OpenJDK 16, you should get the JavaFX SDK (<b>not</b> jmods), Version 16, 
appropriate for your computer.  There is only one choice for MacOS.  For Windows, you 
almost certainly want the first choice, JavaFX Windows x64 SDK.  Be sure to get
Version 16, from the middle of the page, unless you are using a different version of
OpenJDK.</p>

<p>The download is a .zip file.  You will need to extract its contents, if that's not
done automatically &mdash; and you will need to know where they are!  If you are
doing your Java work in a directory named <i>cs124</i>, I suggest copying the contents
of the .zip file to that directory.</p>

<p>Whenever you compile or run a JavaFX program, you have to tell the <i>javac</i> or
<i>java</i> command where to find the JavaFX SDK.  Let's say you are working in a 
directory that is inside the <i>cs124</i> directory.  Then the command for compiling
a program using <i>javac</i> could look something like</p>

<pre>          javac  -p  ../javafx-sdk-16/lib  --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH  MyProgram.java</pre> 

<p>on Mac or</p>

<pre>          javac  -p  ..\javafx-sdk-16\lib  --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH  MyProgram.java</pre> 

<p>on Windows.  Or you could use a full path to the JavaFX SDK. If the JavaFX SDK directory 
is in your home directory, it might look something like</p>


<pre>      javac  -p  /Users/<i>username</i>/javafx-sdk-16/lib  --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH  MyProgram.java</pre> 

<p>on Mac or</p>

<pre>      javac  -p  C:\\Users\<i>username</i>\javafx-sdk-16\lib  --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH  MyProgram.java</pre> 

<p>on Windows.  The <i>java</i> command wouls be similar. </p>

<p>Obviously, you don't want to
have to type commands like this all the time.  See
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s6.html#basics.6.2a">Section&nbsp;2.6.3</a>
in the textbook for some information about how to avoid that.  (And
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s6.html#basics.6.3a">Section&nbsp;2.6.5</a>
explains how to use JavaFX with Eclipse.)</p>
