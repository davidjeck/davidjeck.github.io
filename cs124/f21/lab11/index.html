<h2>CS 124, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 11: Poker Solitaire</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>For this lab, you will work on a GUI program to implement a simple
solitaire card game.  You will work with arrays of objects, including
a two-dimensional array, and you will make a subclass of an existing
class.</p>

<p>You should create an Eclipse project named lab11 or something similar.
You need to add copies of the file and folder from 
<a href="lab11-files/" style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs124_Eck/lab11-files</a>.
There are a lot of files in the folder named "cards", so don't try to download them
individually.  Open the folder <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs124_Eck/lab11-files</span>
in a file browser window, and copy-and-paste the contents of that
directory into the src folder.  (Alternatively, you can download this
<a href="lab11-files.zip">zip&nbsp;archive</a> of the folder and unzip it
to get at the files.)  Make sure that the "cards" directory is in the src folder,
not just in the project; if not, you can drag it into src.  The .java files 
should be in the default package in the src folder.</p>


<p><b>This lab is due next Tuesday.</b></p>

<h3>The Game</h3>

<p>The game that you will implement is a kind of poker solitaire.  It is played
on a five-by-five grid, where each spot in the grid can hold a playing card.
The user sees one card at a time and decides where to place that card in
the grid.  The user cannot move a card after it has been placed in the grid.
The game ends when 25 cards have been placed and the grid is full.
The goal of the game is to try to get good poker hands in each row, in each
column, and in each of the two diagonals.  (You don't need to know poker to
implement the game.)  Scoring can be added to the game by assigning a certain
number of points to each type of poker hand.  However, <b>scoring is optional,
for extra credit,</b> in this lab.  (See the Extra Credit section at the end
of this web page for more information about scoring.)  Here is a picture of
the board in the middle of a game, with the optional scoring:</p>

<h3>About the Image Class and Card Images</h3>

<p>The playing card images that you will use in the game are in .jpg files in
the <i>cards</i> folder that you should have already added to your project.
Those files are being used as "resource files" in the program.  A resource
file is a file that is part of the program but is not a .java file.</p>

<p>In JavaFX, an image is represented by an object of type <i>javafx.scene.image.Image</i>.
The <i>Image</i> class has a constructor that takes a <i>String</i> as a parameter.
The string can be a path to a resource file.  For a resource file that is directly in
the <i>src</i> folder of a project, the path would simply be the name of the file.
For a resource file in a subfolder of <i>src</i>, the path would include the folder name.
For example, to construct an <i>Image</i> object from the file named "C2.jpg" in
the folder named "cards", you can use:</p>

<pre class=code>
Image img = new Image("cards/C2.jpg");
</pre>

<p>If you have an <i>Image</i> object, you can draw the image on a <i>Canvas</i> using
a <i>GraphicsContext</i>, <i>g</i>, with the <i>g.drawImage</i>() method:</p>

<pre class=code>
g.drawImage( img, x, y );
</pre>

<p class=np>The parameters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are of type <i>double</i>.
The upper left corner of the image is placed at the point with coordinates (<i>x,y</i>)
in the canvas.</p>


</div>



<div class="section">

<h3>The GraphicalCard Class</h3>

<p>The file <a href="lab11-files/PokerCard.java"><i>PokerCard.java</i></a> defines
the <i>PokerCard</i> class to represent a standard playing card.  This is a little
different from the <i>Card</i> class that we looked at in class, since it uses 14 for the value
of an ace, rather than&nbsp;1.  That change was made to make it easier to implement some of
the rules of poker.</p>

<p>You should define a new class <i>GraphicalCard</i> as a subclass of <i>PokerCard</i>
to represent a playing card along with its associated image.
(It would certainly be possible to write the solitaire program without defining this class, but
I am requiring you to do so as an exercise.)  The constructor for
a <i>GraphicalCard</i> should still take the value and suit of the card as parameters.
The constructor will need to use <i>super</i> to call the constructor from the
superclass.  (See <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s6.html#OOP.6.3">Section&nbsp;5.6.3</a>;
we went over this in class yesterday.)  But is should also create the <i>Image</i> object for
the card.</p>

<p>Getting the correct name for the image file is a problem, but you certainly don't need 
52 separate cases!  The card image files have
names like "cards/H5.jpg" for the 5 of Hearts, "cards/SK.jpg" for the King of Spaces,
"cards/D10.jpg" for the 10 of Diamonds.  You might notice that the first character in
"H5", "SK", and "D10" is also the first character of the string returned by the
<i>getSuitAsString</i>() instance method in the <i>PokerCard</i> class.  And for 
the second character in the case of a Jack, Queen, King, or Ace, you might look 
at <i>getValueAsString</i>().</p>

<p>The <i>GraphicalCard</i> class also needs an instance method for drawing the image.
As the parameters for that instance method, you need a <i>GraphicsContext</i> and
two <i>doubles</i> for the upper left corner of the image.</p>

<p>Test your class before proceeding.  Add some temporary code to the <i>draw</i>()
method in <i>PokerSolitaire.java</i> to create a <i>GraphicalCard</i> and draw it.</p>

<p>(Note:  The <i>PokerCard</i> class also implements Jokers, but your <i>GraphicalCard</i>
class does not have to support Jokers.  You can ignore them.  However, if you want to
support them, there is <i>joker.jpg</i> file in the <i>cards</i> folder that you can
use for the image.)</p>

<h3>Poker Solitaire</h3>

<p>The rest of the work for the lab will be in the file <i>PokerSolitaire.java</i>.
That program already draws a 5-by-5 grid of empty spaces and a space for drawing the
next available card.  You will finish the implementation.</p>

<p>Some requirements:  Make sure that the user can't place a card in a grid position
that is already occupied.  After the grid is full, the game ends, and the user should 
be able to start a new game (such as by clicking anywhere &mdash; or maybe just by clicking in
the "next card" rectangle which would make it harder to start the new game by accident).
And you should think about what to draw in the "Next Card" spot when the game is over.
You might draw a message saying the game is over.  Another idea is to draw a face-down
card there; the image for the back of a card is in the file "cards/back.jpg".</p>

<p>You will need a deck of 52 <i>GraphicalCards</i>.  My version of the program
simply uses an instance variable of type <i>GraphicalCard</i>[], along with an <i>int</i>
variable to keep track of which card in the array is the next card to be played
in the game.  I had to create all the cards for the array, and shuffle the deck at
the start of each game.  We looked at a <i>Deck</i> class that does all that.
You can use code that is very similar to the code from 
<a href="Deck.java">Deck.java</a>, 
but watch out for the fact that an Ace in the <i>GraphicalCard</i> class has value 14, not&nbsp;1</i>.
(Alternatively,  you could make a <i>GraphicalDeck</i> class that is almost a copy of <i>Deck.java</i>,
using <i>GraphicalCards</i> instead of <i>Cards</i>.  Unfortunately, you can't simply use
the unmodified <i>Deck</i> class.)</p>

<p>You need to add a mouse-pressed event handler to the program to react when the user
clicks the canvas.  See the section on "Mouse Events" from the <a href="../lab10/index.html">previous&nbsp;lab</a>
if you need a reminder about how to do that.  Much of the work of the game is done in
the mouse event handler.</p>

<p>When the user clicks the canvas, and a game is in progress, you need to determine
where the user is trying to place the next card.  You get the (x,y)-coordinates of the
point where the user clicked from the mouse event.  You need to check which of the empty
rectangles, if any, contains the point (x,y).  One way to do that uses nested for loops
similar to the ones that are used in the <i>draw</i>() method to draw the empty rectangles.
(It is also possible to simply calculate the row and column number from x and&nbsp;y,
if you are mathematically inclined.)  You should ignore any mouse click that is not
in one of the empty rectangles.  In particular, if the user clicks a rectangle that
already contains a card, you should ignore it.</p>

<p>There are two approaches to drawing the board.  One is to completely redraw the
board any time anything needs to be changed.  In this approach, the <i>draw</i> method
must redraw the board completely, based on the current state of all the instance variables.
Whenever a change is made to an instance variable that affects the contents of the board,
<i>draw</i>() must be called to redraw the board.  This might seem inefficient, but
it is often the best approach since it is easy to make sure that the appearance of the 
board exactly reflects the state of the program.</p>

<p>The second approach is to try to redraw just part of the board when something changes.
For example, when the user places a card, just draw that card.  But then, you also have
to remember to draw the new next card.  And if you are doing scoring, the score might need
to be updated.  You can make it work in this program (especially if you are not doing
scoring), but in general it can be hard to get right.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit: Scoring</h3>

<p>Scoring is not a requirement of this lab, but you can get five points of extra
credit for implementing it.  The coding is a little tedious, but a lot of the work
will be done by an object of type <i>PokerRank</i>, defined by the file
<a href="lab11-files/PokerRank.java">PokerRank.java</a>.
A&nbsp;PokerRank object, <i>ranker</i>, can compute a rank for a hand of from
zero to five <i>PokerCards</i>.  The rank is an integer from 0 to 9 and is returned
by <i>ranker.getHandType</i>().  A name for the rank, such as "Two&nbsp;Pairs" or
"Flush", is returned by <i>ranker.getHandTypeAsString</i>().  The number of points
that you should award for each rank is shown in the table below.  Consider storing
the point values in an array.</p>

<p>You really only need one <i>ranker</i> object of type <i>PokerRank</i>.  To use it to get the rank
of a hand of cards, first call <i>ranker.clear</i>() to remove any cards that have
previously been added.  Then call <i>ranker.add</i>(<i>card</i>) for each
card in the hand.  Note that <i>card</i> cannot be null.  Then you can use 
<i>ranker.getHandType</i>() and <i>ranker.getHandTypeAsString</i>().</p>

<p>You need to apply the <i>ranker</i> to each row, to each column, and to the
two diagonals.  The cards in the grid are stored in a two-dimensional array.
You just need to go through the relevant part of the array and add the appropriate cards to <i>ranker</i>,
being careful not to add <i>null</i> values.  You want to display the type of
each hand and the number of points for that hand.  You also want to display
the total points for all 12 hands, which is the user's overall score in the game.
