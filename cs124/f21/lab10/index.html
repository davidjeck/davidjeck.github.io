<h2>CS 124, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 10: GUI Tutorial</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>This lab in a short tutorial on GUI programming with JavaFX.  It introduces some of
the fundamental ideas of programming with JavaFX and of GUI programming in general.
You will write a simple sketching program.  Most of the code from the program is on
this web page, and you should simply copy-and-paste it into your program.  There are
some points where you have to write some code yourself, but most of that will be
very similar to the code that is given to you.</p>

<p><b>The lab will be due next Tuesday.  You can just turn in the file named 
"Sketcher.java".  (Or turn in an entire Eclipse project, if you prefer.)</b></p>

<p>The work from <a href="../lab9/index.html">Lab&nbsp;9</a> is not officially due until
Friday &mdash; but remember that you only have to turn in Note.java and Tune.java because
of the disaster with sound on the computers in the lab.</p>

<h3>About Events and Lambda Expressions</h3>

<p>One of the major things that make GUI programs different from command-line programs is <i>events</i>.
Instead of scripting the interaction between the user and the program from beginning to end,
like the <i>main</i>() routine in a command line program, a GUI program responds to events
when they happen, which can be outside the control of the program.  Events can include things
like clicking the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, or choosing a command from
a menu.</p>

<p>In JavaFX, the response to an event is programmed by an <i>event handler</i>.  An event
handler for an event is a subroutine that the system will call whenever the event occurs.
As a programmer, you provide the subroutine, but you don't control when it is called.</p>

<p>An event handler in JavaFX is usually defined by something called a <i>lambda expression</i>.
A lamda expression is a simplified way of writing a subroutine, without all the usual syntax of
a subroutine definition.  Here is an example of using a lambda expression to define an
event handler:</p>

<pre class=code>
clearButton.setOnAction( evt -> g.fillRect(0,0,800,600) );
</pre>

<p class=code>The event in this case would be the user clicking on a button named <i>clearButton</i>.
This is an example of an "action event", and the response to the event is programmed by
the <i>setOnAction</i>() method.  The parameter to the method is the lambda expression&nbsp;
<code style="white-space:pre">evt -> g.fillRect(0,0,800,600)</code>.  And the meaning is
that when the user clicks the button, the command <code>g.fillRect(0,0,800,600)</code> will be
executed.</p>

<p>The lambda expression represents a subroutine.  The <i>evt</i> in the expression represents
a parameter coming into the subroutine.  The parameter is an object containing information about
the event.  In this case, the parameter is not used, but it has to be there.  Sometimes the
information in the parameter is important.  For example, if <i>evt</i> represents a mouse click
on a canvas, then <i>evt.getX</i>() and <i>evt.getY</i>() are the coordinates on the canvas where
the mouse was clicked.</p>

<p>All of the lambda expressions in this lab will look similar to the one in this
example.  If you want to know more about them, see 
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c4/s5.html">Section&nbsp;4.5</a>, but you don't 
need to read that section to do this lab.</p>

<h3>About Imports in JavaFX Programs</h3>

<p>JavaFX programs tend to use a large number of classes from a large number of packages,
and all of those classes must be imported at the top of the program.   When you are using
Eclipse and you add a reference to a class that has not yet been imported, it will be
marked as an error.  Among the error fixes that Eclipse offers should be one that imports
the class that you want.  But you should be sure to pick the right class, when there are
several possible classes with the same name (in different packages).  For JavaFX programming, the class that you
want will be in a package whose name starts with "javafx".  However, to make things easy
for you in this lab, I will give you all the imports that you will need.</p>


</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Starting a JavaFX Application</h3>

<p>There are no files for you to copy for this lab.  You will create a Java file from scratch.
You should create a project named something like <i>lab10</i>, but be sure that it is set to
use the JRE that includes JavaFX.  (You set up that JRE in <a href="../lab8/index.html">Lab&nbsp;8</a>.)</p>

<p>We start with a pretty minimal JavaFX program.  Create a class named <i>Sketcher</i>, in the default package.  Erase the original text 
from the file, and replace it with the following program, which you should copy-and-paste from this page.
The program includes the full list of imports that are used by my completed version of the program, so you won't have
to worry about importing them later, but many of them will be marked as unused until you add the code that
uses them later in the lab.</p>

<pre class=code>
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.geometry.Pos;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.canvas.Canvas;
import javafx.scene.canvas.GraphicsContext;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.Menu;
import javafx.scene.control.MenuBar;
import javafx.scene.control.MenuItem;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane;
import javafx.scene.layout.HBox;
import javafx.scene.paint.Color;
import javafx.scene.shape.StrokeLineCap;
import javafx.scene.text.Font;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class Sketcher extends Application {
        
    private Canvas canvas;     // The canvas where the user will draw.
    private GraphicsContext g; // The graphics context for drawing on the canvas.

    /**
     * Create and set up the program window and event handling.
     */
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        canvas = new Canvas(800,600);
        g = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();
        g.setFill(Color.WHITE);
        g.fillRect(0, 0, 800, 600);
        BorderPane content = new BorderPane();
        content.setCenter(canvas);
        Scene scene = new Scene(content);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.setTitle("Sketcher: Draw on a Canvas");
        stage.setResizable(false); 
        stage.show();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(); // Run the Application; this will not return.
    }

}
</pre>

<p class=np>You should already be able to run the program, and see the window that it creates.
The program ends when you close the window.  We will be talking this week about what
"extends" means in the first line of the class definition.  For now, you only need
to know that an object of type <i>Sketcher</i> represents the JavaFX Application that
you are writing.</p>

<p>When you run the program, the system calls <i>main</i>(), whose only purpose here
is to run the JavaFX Application.  The <i>launch</i>() method creates a window for the program and calls
the <i>start</i>() method in the object that represents the application.  The window is represented by the object of 
type <i>Stage</i> that comes into the <i>start</i>() method as a parameter.
A <i>Stage</i> contains a <i>Scene</i>, which contains the content of the window.
Here, the content is a <i>BorderPane</i>.  A <i>BorderPane</i> is a rectangular
area that contains a "center" component &mdash; in this case, the <i>Canvas</i> &mdash; and
also has room for other components at the top, bottom, left, and right of the center 
component.  You will add other components to the <i>BorderPane</i> later in the lab.
The <i>canvas</i> is a component that can be be drawn on, and <i>g</i> is an object 
that is used for doing the drawing.  You have used <i>g</i> in previous programs that
you worked on as the name of an object that is used to draw on a canvas.</p>


</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Mouse Events</h3>

<p>It's time to program a response to some events.  When the user presses a mouse
button while the mouse cursor is over the canvas, a "mouse pressed" event is generated.
If the user then drags the mouse while holding down the button, a series of "mouse dragged" 
events is generated.  When the user releases the mouse, a "mouse released" event is
generated.  You will program responses to the mouse pressed events and mouse dragged
events to let the user sketch a curve on the canvas.  (You won't need the mouse
released event in this program.)  The events are associated with the canvas, 
so the event handlers are added to the canvas.  You can add these statements
at the end of the <i>start</i>() method (or anywhere in that method after the
canvas has been created):</p>

<pre class=code>
canvas.setOnMousePressed( evt -> doMouseDown(evt.getX(), evt.getY()) );
canvas.setOnMouseDragged( evt -> doMouseDragged(evt.getX(), evt.getY()) );
</pre>

<p class=np>You will then need to add definitions to the class for the methods <i>doMouseDown</i>()
and <i>doMouseDragged</i>().  The idea is that when the user presses
a mouse button while the mouse cursor is over the canvas, the method
<i>doMouseDown</i>() will be called, and the parameters to that method will
tell the coordinates of the point in the canvas where the mouse cursor was located.
As the user drags the mouse, <i>doMouseDragged</i> will be called repeatedly,
with the new coordinates of the mouse cursor as its parameters.  The parameters
to these methods are of type <i>double</i>, and the methods do not return a value.
Every time that <i>doMouseDragged</i>() is called, you want to draw a
line from the previous position of the mouse cursor to its current position.
You need a way to remember the previous position of the mouse, so add these
instance variables to the class:</p>

<pre class=code>
private double prevX, prevY;  // Previous mouse position for doMouseDown
</pre>

<p class=np><b>Assignment:</b> Add definitions for <i>doMouseDown</i> and <i>doMouseDragged</i>.
The method <i>doMouseDown</i> only needs to save the values of its parameters in
<i>prevX</i> and <i>prevY</i>, to get them ready for the first call to <i>doMouseDragged</i>.
The <i>doMouseDragged</i> method only needs to draw a line from <i>(prevX,prevY)</i> 
to the point given by its parameters, and then save the values of those parameters 
in <i>prevX</i> and <i>prevY</i> to get ready for the next call to <i>doMouseDragged</i>.</p>

<p>You should then be able to run the program and use the mouse to draw a curve on
the canvas.  The curve will be black and will have line width equal to&nbsp;1, since
those are the default values when a canvas is first created.</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Color and Line Width Menus</h3>

<p>The next step is to add menus to the top of the window to let the user control 
the color and the line width of the curves that they sketch.</p>

<p>A menu is represented by an object of type <i>Menu</i>.  
The menus for a program should all go into a "menu bar", which gets added to the top
of the window.  A menu bar is represented by an object of type <i>MenuBar</i>.
The items in a menu are represented by objects of type <i>MenuItem</i>.
A basic menu item is like a button: When the user clicks it, there is an
action event, and you can program a response to that event to carry out the
command associated with the menu item.  Here is a method that
creates a menu bar containing one menu, with some
commands for changing the stroke color in the graphics context:</p>

<pre class=code>
/**
 * Create a menu bar to be added to the top of the program window.
 */
private MenuBar makeMenus() {
    MenuBar menubar;
    Menu menu;
    MenuItem item;
    
    menubar = new MenuBar();  // Create the menu bar.
    
    menu = new Menu("CurveColor");   // Create the color menu
    menubar.getMenus().add(menu);    //  ... and add it to the menu bar.
    
    item = new MenuItem("Black");
    item.setOnAction( evt -> g.setStroke(Color.BLACK) );
    menu.getItems().add(item);
    item = new MenuItem("Red");
    item.setOnAction( evt -> g.setStroke(Color.RED) );
    menu.getItems().add(item);
    item = new MenuItem("Blue");
    item.setOnAction( evt -> g.setStroke(Color.BLUE) );
    menu.getItems().add(item);
        
    return menubar;
}
</pre>

<p class=np>The parameter to the <i>Menu</i> constructor is the text that appears in the menu bar
as the name the menu; the user clicks that text to reveal the menu.  The parameter to the
<i>MenuItem</i> constructor is the text that appears in menu for that item.  Note that
a menu has to be added to <i>menubar.getMenus</i>(), which is a list of the menus that
the menu bar contains; a similar remark applies to adding items to menus.</p>

<p>To get the menu bar to appear in the window, you need to add it to the content of the
window.  You want to add it to the top position in the <i>BorderPane</i> named <i>content</i>.
You should do that in the <i>start</i>() method any time <b>after</b> <i>content</i> has been
created but <b>before</b> the <i>stage</i> is shown.  (If you add something to a window after
the window has been shown, the window might not be resized properly to show the new content.)
The command that you need to add is</p>

<pre class="code">
content.setTop( makeMenus() );
</pre>

<p class=np>You should then be able to run the program and sketch curves in different colors.</p>

<p><b>Assignment:</b>  Add code to the definition of <i>makeMenus</i>() to add a few more
colors to the "CurveColor" menu.  Then add another menu, named "CurveWidth", that contains
commands for changing the line width in the graphics context.  You should include at least
the widths 1, 2, 5, 10, and&nbsp;20.</p>

<p>You will find that wide lines don't look very good. The problem is that they don't fit together
nicely at their endpoints.  To improve the appearance, you can make line endpoints rounded with the following
command, which can go in the <i>start</i>(0) method.</p>

<pre class="code">
g.setLineCap( StrokeLineCap.ROUND );
</pre>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Text Stamper</h3>

<p>There are many other kinds of components in JavaFX besides canvases and menus.  Some basic
ones are covered in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c6/s4.html">Section&nbsp;6.4</a>.
To give you some idea of how they can be used in a program, you will add a "Clear" button and
a "text stamper" feature to the program.  Clicking the "Clear" button will simply fill
the canvas with white.  When using the text stamper, clicking the canvas will add a 
string of text to the canvas.  The user will specify the text by typing it into
a text input box.  You will add a component to the bottom of the window that
contains the button, a label for the input box, and the input box.</p>

<p>The component at the bottom of the window will be an object of type <i>HBox</i>,
which holds a horizontal list of smaller components.  The clear button is of type
<i>Button</i>, the input box is of type <i>TextField</i>, and the label for the
input box is of type <i>Label</i>.  Here is a method that creates the <i>HBox</i>.
Copy it into your program, but note that <i>textInput</i> must be declared as
an instance variable of type <i>TextField</i>, since it will be needed in another
method.</p>

<pre class=code>
/**
 * Make an HBox for the bottom of the window, containing a "Clear" button
 * and a text input box to be used for the Text Stamper tool.
 */
private HBox makeBottom() {
    
    Button clearButton = new Button("Clear");
    
    Label label = new Label("Text for Stamper:");
    
    textField = new TextField("Hello World");  // an input box containing "Hello World"
    textField.setPrefColumnCount(30); // make it big enough to contain 30 chars
    
    HBox container = new HBox(15, clearButton, label, textField);
    container.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER); // center contents in the HBox
    container.setStyle( // CSS styling for the HBox
        "-fx-padding: 5px; -fx-border-color: black; -fx-background-color: lightgray" );
    return container;
}
</pre>

<p class=np>Add the HBox to the window with the following command in the <i>start</i>() method, before
the window is shown:</p>

<pre class=code>
content.setBottom( makeBottom() );
</pre>

<p class=code>If you run the program, you should see the components at the bottom of the window.
 The next step is to make them work.</p>

<p><b>Make the "Clear" button work</b> by adding an event handler for an action event on that window.
It can be added in the <i>makeBottom</i>() method, where the clear button is
created. The event handler has to erase the current drawing by filling the entire canvas with white.  
This requires two commands, to set the fill color to white and then fill a rectangle the same
size as the canvas.  We haven't seen a lambda expression before that includes two commands.
The syntax of lambda expressions requires that the commands must be made into a block by enclosing
them in braces.  The code for setting the action event handler for the button can be written:</p>

<pre class=code>
clearButton.setOnAction( evt -> { 
    g.setFill(Color.WHITE); 
    g.fillRect(0,0,800,600); 
});
</pre>

<p><b>Assignment:</b> Dealing with the text input is more complicated, since now the mouse can do two different
things: either draw some text, or draw a curve.  We think of this as having two different
"tools" available in the program.  The program has to keep track of which tool is being
used.  Add an instance variable named <i>currentTool</i> to the program so it can keep track
of which tool is currently in use.  (The type could be either <i>int</i> or <i>string</i>, and
the initial value can say that the current tool draws a curve.)  Add a "Tool" menu to the
menu bar where the user can select the tool.  It should have two entries, such as "Draw Curve"
and "Stamp Text".  The action event handler for each menu item should just change the value of
<i>currentTool</i>.  Finally, you have to modify the <i>doMouseDown</i>() and <i>doMouseDragged</i>)()
methods to take account of the value of <i>currentTool</i>.  The code currently in those methods
should only be used if the current tool is the curve drawing tool.  If the current tool is
the text stamper tool, then <i>doMouseDragged</i> should do nothing, and <i>doMouseDown</i>
should place a copy of the text from the text input box at (x,y).  To get the text from
the input box, call <i>textField.getText</i>(), which returns a <i>String</i>.  Recall that
a string can be drawn in a graphics context <i>g</i> using the method <i>g.fillText</i>(str,x,y).</p>

<p><b>Assignment:</b> Finally, add a "Font Size" menu to control the size of the font used by
the text stamper tool.  Recall that the font size can be set by calling <i>g.setFont(Font.font(n))</i>,
where <i>n</i> gives the height of the text in pixels.  (The original font in <i>g</i> has size&nbsp;12.)</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Extra Credit</h3>

<p>For a little extra credit, you can add a "Burst" tool to the program (named after the <i>burst</i> method in the
turtle graphics lab).  It will be the third tool in the "Tools" menu.  When the mouse is dragged using the "Burst" tool, 
instead of drawing a line from the previous
mouse position to the current mouse position, draw a line from the point where the mouse button
was first pressed to the current mouse position.  You will need new instance variables to
record the position where the mouse was pressed.  (Bursts actually look better if the 
line width is 1.)</p>

<p>Another possible extra credit idea is to implement a "TextColor" menu to set the fill color
that will be used by the text tool.  But be careful, because the fill color is also changed by
the "Clear" button.  To make the "TextColor" menu work correctly,you will need to add an instance
variable to record the text color, so that you will be able to correctly set the fill color before
drawing the text.</p>
