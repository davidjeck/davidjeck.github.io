<h2>CS 124, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 9: Classes and Objects</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>For this lab, you will write two complete classes, and you will complete a main program
that uses those classes.  The program will use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">Midi</a> to play short tunes.
In addition to the classes that you write, the program will use a class named 
SimpleSynth that provides a simplified interface to Java's Midi support.
This lab might also teach you some things about packages, testing, and error-handling.
</p>

<p>You will need a copy of the file <a href="lab9-files/midi/SimpleSynth.java">SimpleSynth.java</a>,
which must be inside a folder named midi because the SimpleSynth class is in a package named midi.
You will also need a copy of <a href="lab9-files/MidiPlayer.java">MidiPlayer.java</a>,
which is the incomplete main program that you will work on.  MidiPlayer.java is in the default package,
and should be copied directly in the src folder of your project.
You will probably also want copies of three short programs in the default package:
<a href="lab9-files/TestMidi.java">TestMidi.java</a>,
<a href="lab9-files/TestNote.java">TestNote.java</a>, and
<a href="lab9-files/TestTune.java">TestTune.java</a>. You will not do any work on these three
programs, but they can be used to test various aspects of the project, as discussed below.
 <b>Note that MidiProgram, TestNote.java, and TestTune.java will have errors until
you have written the Note and Tune classes that they use.</b>
All of these files can be found in <a style="white-space:pre" href="lab9-files/">/classes/cs124_Eck/lab9-files</a>
or downloaded from the web.  Since there are a lot of files, you also have the option of downloading
<a href="lab9-files.zip">this zip archive</a> and extracting its contents to get all the files.</p>

<p>You should turn in your work for the lab in a folder named "lab9" or "lab9-files" or something similar.
It can be a complete Eclipse project folder, but does not have to be.
The work that you turn in must include these three files:
<b>Note.java</b>, <b>Tune.java</b>, and <b>MidiPlayer.java</b>.  These files must work with the original
version of SimpleSynth.java, which must be in package midi.  Do not modify
SimpleSynth.java or move it out of package midi.</p>

<p><b>This lab should be due in a week &mdash; however, because of the test next Monday,
it will not be collected until Friday, November&nbsp;5.</b>

<h3>About Midi and SimpleSynth</h3>

<p>MIDI (Musical Instrument Device Interface)
was designed as a way for computers to control musical instruments.  Midi can also be used to
control a "synthesizer" that is part of the sound card on a computer.  A synthesizer can
play notes through the computer's speakers that imitate the sounds of various instruments.
Midi has a set of 128 standard "instruments", although not all of them sound realistic and some
of them don't actually imitate instruments as such.  Also, some with different names sound
the same to me. I expect it all depends on the sound card. The instruments are often numbered from 1 to 128 in
the documentation, but in Midi programs, they are actually numbered from 0 to 127.  A Midi
instrument is specified by an integer in the range 0 to&nbsp;127.</p>

<p>One can do some complex things with Midi, but it supports very simple uses with a few commands
for turning particular notes on and off, for selecting the volume, and for selecting the
instrument that is used.  (It is possible to have several different instruments 
playing different notes at the same time, but we won't be doing that.)
Like instruments, the possible notes are identified by numbers in the range
from 0 to 127, and the possible volumes are also numbered 0 to 127. 
Note number 60 is "Middle&nbsp;C" (the middle key on a piano keyboard).
There are 12 notes to an octave, so going up an octave means adding 12 to the 
note number.</p>

<p>The file <a href="lab9-files/midi/SimpleSynth.java">SimpleSynth.java</a> defines a simple
interface to some of the most basic Midi capabilities.  A program really only needs one
synthesizer, but nevertheless, you need an object of type <i>SimpleSynth</i> to represent the
synthesizer.  If <i>synth</i> is that object, then you can call
 <i>synth.noteOn</i>(<i>noteNumber</i>) and
<i>synth.noteOff</i>(<i>noteNumber</i>) to turn particular notes on and off.
(It is possible to have several notes playing at the same time, but only on the
same instrument.)  You can use
<i>synth.setVolume</i>(<i>volumeNumber</i>) to control volume and <i>synth.setInstrument</i>(<i>instrumentNumber</i>)
to select the instrument.
There are a few static named constants such as <i>SimpleSynth.PIANO</i> and <i>SimpleSynth.TIMPANI</i>
that give the instrument
numbers for some common instruments that should sound OK.  There is also a static method
<i>SimpleSynth.getNameForInstrument</i>(<i>N</i>) that returns the official name for
a given instrument number.  <b>Read the Javadoc comments in SimpleSynth.java
for more information!</b>  The source code includes a complete list of instrument names.</p>

<p>To play a note, you have to turn a note on, wait a while, and then turn the note off.
There is a standard method <i>Thread.sleep</i>(<i>n</i>) that implements a pause of <i>n</i> milliseconds.
(One thousand milliseconds equal one second.)
You can use <i>Thread.sleep</i>() to implement "wait a while", but it can throw a funny exception that has to
be caught, even though it will never happen in this program.
So the code for delaying by n milliseconds is</p>

<pre class=code>
try {
    Thread.sleep(n);
}
catch (InterruptedException e) {
}
</pre>

<p class=np>
You would put this code between calls to <i>synth.noteOn</i>(<i>noteNumber</i>) on
<i>synth.noteOff</i>(<i>noteNumber</i>) to play a note.  Or use it by itself to implement
a period of silence.
See the sample program <a href="lab9-files/TestMidi.java">TestMidi.java</a> for
an example of playing notes &mdash; and run it to see what it does. This will test
the Midi system on your computer.  If you don't
hear anything, make sure that the volume on your computer is not turned completely off. <i>TestMidi</i>
plays no other role in this lab.</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h3>About the Program</h3>

<p>The main program for this lab, <i>MidiPlayer.java</i>, uses two classes that
you will write, <i>Note</i> and <i>Tune</i>, to implement playing tunes using Midi.
You can't work on the main program until you have written those classes, but you should
know what the program is expected to do.</p>

<p>The main program that you will work on will accept and carry out commands from
the user.  The commands will let the user create and play tunes, and select the
volume and instrument that are used to play them.  The tunes are played using Midi.
The program is a simple command-line program, not a GUI program.  The user types in 
commands, and the computer responds, either by carrying out the command
or by reporting an error in the command.  The program should never crash.
A command is one line of input from the user, containing the command itself
followed by any data that the command requires. Here are the commands that you will implement:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>play</b> &mdash; This command must be followed by a list of integers in the
range -1 to 127 representing Midi note numbers, except that -1 is used to 
represent a pause.  The program should play the tune consisting of those
notes and it should record the tune so that it can be replayed.  The notes can all
be of the same duration.  Note that only
the most recently played tune is saved, so the program only has to keep track
of one played tune.</li>
<li><b>random</b> &mdash; Create a random tune and save it to be replayed.  No data needed.
Information about random tunes is at the end of this web page.</li>
<li><b>replay</b> &mdash; Play the tune that was most recently played and saved,
either by the <i>play</i> command or by the <i>random</i> command.  No data needed.</li>
<li><b>volume</b> &mdash; Change the volume in the Midi synthesizer.  The data is a single number giving the new volume level.</li>
<li><b>instrument</b> &mdash; Change the instrument in the Midi synthesizer.  The data is a single number giving the Midi instrument.</li>
</ul>

<p class=np>You must implement at least this functionality.  You can add other features if you want, possibly for extra credit,
such as the ability to specify instruments by name as well as by number or data for the random command that
will specify parameters for the random tune that is produced.  I'm sure you can think of
other possibilities.</p>

<p>Here is a complete run of my program.  The computer prompts the user with ">>", and the program
ends when the user inputs an empty line.  User input is shown in bold.
Some of the possible errors are illustrated.</p>

<pre class=code>
Enter your commands at the '>>' prompt.
Enter an empty line to exit.

>> <b>replay</b>
You don't have a tune yet!  Make one first.

>> <b>play 112 88 76 -1 64 52 40 -1 28 16</b>         <span style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold">(Sounds play)</span>

>> <b>instrument xylophone</b>

>> <b>volume 90</b>

>> <b>replay</b>                                      <span style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold">(Sounds play)</span>

>> <b>rando</b>m                                      <span style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold">(Sounds play)</span>

>> <b>instrument theremin</b>       
Sorry, an error occurred:
   The instrument must be a number or valid instrument name.
   Valid names are:  piano xylophone flute    guitar timpani
                     oboe  trumpet   trombone organ  harp
Try another command.

>> <b>instrument -1</b>
Sorry, an error occurred:
   Midi instrument numbers must be in the range 0 to 127
Try another command.

>> <b>volume fred</b>
Sorry, an error occurred:
   Volume must be specified as an integer.
Try another command.

>> <b>help</b>
Sorry, an error occurred:
   help is not a legal command.
Try another command.

>>                                <span style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold">(User just presses return)</span>

Bye!
</pre>

</div>



<div class="section">
<h3>The Note Class</h3>

<p>You should create a new class named <i>Note</i>.  It makes sense for Note.java
to be in the <i>midi</i> package, since it is part of a general Midi system that could be
used in other programs besides this one.    
When you create the class in Eclipse, make sure that the "package" input
in the New Java Class dialog is set to <i>midi</i>.
(On the other hand, the main program class,
<i>MidiPlayer</i> is just one program that uses Midi, and does not really belong in
the <i>midi</i> package, so I put it in the default package.)</p>

<p>A <i>Note</i> object will represent some specific note, to be
played for some specific duration.  Since you are working with objects here, there will
be nothing <i>static</i> in the class.</p>

<p>A note needs two instance variables to represent the Midi note number for the note and
the number of milliseconds for which the note will play.  To allow for silences in a tune,
we can extend midi note numbering by using -1 to 
represent a period of silence.  The <i>Note</i> class is required to have a constructor
that specifies the note number and the time in milliseconds.  This means that a <i>Note</i>
object can be created, for example, as <tt>new&nbsp;Note(60,100)</tt>.  The constructor
should throw an <i>IllegalArgumentException</i> if the values passed as parameters to the
constructor are not legal values for the instance variables.  The legal values for
note number are -1 through 127.</p>

<p>A note is also required to have a <i>play</i>() method, with a parameter of type
<i>SimpleSynth</i>.  To play a note requires a
Midi synthesizer, that is, an object of type <i>SimpleSynth</i>.  The <i>SimpleSynth</i> object
should be a parameter to the <i>play</i>() method, <b>not</b> a variable in the <i>Note</i> class.
This means that if <i>note</i> is a <i>Note</i>
and <i>synth</i> is a <i>SimpleSynth</i> in some program, then that program can call <tt>note.play(synth)</tt>
to make the synthesizer play the note.</p>

<p>You should follow good style when writing <i>Note.java</i>.  For example, the instance
variables should be <i>private</i>.  (They could, in fact, be <i>final</i>.)  And you might
provide getter methods for the instance variables, even though they are not required by this
project.  It would be nice to have a <i>Note</i> class that is somewhat general and could
be used in other projects.  And don't forget comments, in Javadoc style!</p>

<p>When the <i>Note</i> class is written correctly, the program <i>TestNote.java</i> should
no longer have any errors.  You should be able to run that program, and it should play a few
notes.  Read <i>TestNote.java</i> for an example of how the <i>Note</i> class can be used.</p>

<p>(A remark about packages and <i>import</i>:  The <i>Note</i> class uses the <i>SimpleSynth</i>
class, but it does not have to import it because both classes are in the same package.
A class can use other classes in the same class without importing them.  The class
<i>TestNote</i>, on the other hand, which is outside the <i>midi</i> package, has to
import both classes.)</p>

</div>



<div class="section">
<h3>The Tune Class</h3>

<p>Next, you should create another new class, named <i>Tune</i>, in the <i>midi</i> package. 
 A <i>Tune</i> object represents a list of notes. Each note
is represented by an object of type <i>Note</i>. Playing
a tune will mean playing each of the <i>Notes</i> in the list.</p>

<p>The list of notes can be represented by a partially full array of type <i>Note</i><tt>[]</tt>.
This would require two instance variables, one for the array and one for the number of notes 
that are actually stored in the array.  You can make the array big enough to hold any reasonably
sized tune &mdash; say length 1000.
(Alternatively, if you feel comfortable with the <i>ArrayList</i> class that was mentioned
briefly in class,
you could store the notes in a single variable of type <i>ArrayList</i>&lt;<i>Note</i>&gt;.
For more information about <i>ArrayList</i>, 
see <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/s3.html">Section&nbsp;7.3</a>)</p>

<p>The <i>Tune</i> class is required to have a constructor that has no parameters, so that
a <i>Tune</i> can be created by calling <tt>new&nbsp;Tune()</tt>.  The constructor can
create the note array (or arraylist).</p>

<p>The <i>Tune</i> class is also required to have a method named <i>add</i>(), with one parameter of type
<i>Note</i> that adds one <i>Note</i> to the
list of notes.  That is, if <i>tune</i> is a <i>Tune</i> and <i>note</i> is a <i>Note</i>,
then calling <i>tune.add(note)</i> will add the note to the tune.</p>

<p>And the <i>Tune</i> class is required to have a method named <i>play</i>(),  with one parameter of
type <i>SimpleSynth</i> that it will use to play all of the notes in the tune.</p>

<p>There are some other methods that you might add for a well-designed class, even though they
are not used in this lab:  a method that returns the number of notes in the tune, and a method
for getting the i<sup>th</sup> note.</p>

<p>Of course, you should follow good programming style when writing the <i>Tune</i> class!
</p>

<p>When class <i>Tune</i> is correctly written, the errors in the <i>TestTune</i> class should
be gone.  You can run that program to test the <i>Tune</i> class.</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>The MidiPlayer Class</h3>

<p>Now that the <i>Note</i> and <i>Tune</i> classes are written, you can work on the main
program, <i>MidiPlayer.java</i>.  The operation of the program is described above.
The basic outline of the program is already there in <i>MidiPlayer.java</i>.
You just have to implement the <i>doCommand</i>() method (and, hopefully, add a few
more methods to handle the user inputs that can't be handled in just one or two lines
of code).  Please also add a Javadoc command for the <i>MidiPlayer</i> class!</p>

<p>The <i>MidiPlayer</i> class already has global variables <i>synth</i> and <i>tune</i>
representing the Midi synthesizer and the tune that has been most recently played.  You 
can use these variables in <i>doCommand</i>.</p>

<p>The parameter to <i>doCommand</i>() is an array of Strings.  The strings are the individual
items from the user's line of input.  For example, if the user inputs "play&nbsp;40&nbsp;42&nbsp;44"
then the array will be of length four and will hold the strings "play", "40", "42", and "44".
If the user's input was "replay", then the array will be of length one.  You have to decode
the command and carry it out if it is a legal command.  If you discover any error in the
command, you should throw an <i>IllegalArgumentException</i>.  You do not have to do anything
to handle the error, except to throw the exception; the error will be caught in
the <i>main</i>() routine and will be reported there.  Note that strings that represent
numbers will have to be converted to values of type <i>int</i> using the method <i>Integer.parseInt</i>,
which will throw a <i>NumberFormatException</i> if the string does not represent an integer.</p>

<p>Note also that methods in the <i>Note</i> and <i>SimpleSynth</i> classes already throw
exceptions when when they are given illegal data.  You do not have to check for or do anything
about those errors in the <i>doCommand</i>() method.  If an error is thrown in the <i>Note</i>
or <i>SimpleSynth</i> class, and is not caught in <i>doCommand</i>(), then it will automatically
cause the <i>doCommand</i>() method to terminate, and the
error will be handled in the <i>main</i>() routine.</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>About Creating a Random Tune</h3>

<p>One part of the assignment is to create random tunes.  Now, you could make a random tune simply
by adding a bunch of notes with randomly selected note numbers to a <i>Tune</i>, but that would 
probably sound bad, so you should do something nicer.  Notes should not jump around randomly,
Instead, the notes should do a kind of random walk along the keyboard.
My own idea for making a random tune was that the change from one note to
the next should ordinarily be small, but that sometimes there should be larger jumps.
That is, I select a random change in the note number from one note to the next,
with small changes much more likely than large changes.
(If you think about it, this is kind of like the problem of selecting a random number of
runs scored in an inning in our baseball simulation.)  I also add occasional random pauses. 
You might also play with the idea of random durations for the notes.
My random songs are 100 notes long.</p>

<p>When selecting random values or doing a random walk, you should make sure that the
note numbers lie in a reasonable range.  Although there are 128 possible note numbers,
many of the notes are actually just about inaudible to human hearing.  My program makes sure that
the note numbers remain in the range from 36 to 84.</p>

<h3>Some Style Rules for Methods and Classes</h3>

<style>
   ul {
      margin-left: -30px;
      margin-right: 30px
   }
</style>

<ul class="lessindent">
<li>A method should have a clear, single, identifiable task.</li>
<li>An individual method definition should
   not be too long.  In general, a function should not be longer than
   one printed page (and that is stretching it).</li>
<li>Methods can access the global
   variables that represent the state of an object or of a class, but you should avoid using 
   global variables simply to pass information from one method to another &mdash; for
   that, you should use parameters and return values.</li>
<li>A class should represent a clear, single, identifiable concept.</li>
<li>Use the modifiers <tt>public</tt>,
   <tt>protected</tt>, and <tt>private</tt> to control access to the variables
   and methods in a class.</li>
<li>Most instance variables should
   be declared to be private.  Getter and setter methods can be provided to 
   access and manipulate the private instance variables.</li>
<li>Use Javadoc-style comments to document any variable, method, or class that
is public (and maybe for everything that is not <tt>private</tt> &mdash; and they can 
even be used for <tt>private</tt> things).
A Javadoc comment always comes immediately before the
thing it is commenting.  Ideally, use the Javadoc tags @param, @return, @throws
to document the parameters, return value, and exceptions used by a method.
</ul>
