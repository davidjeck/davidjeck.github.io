<h2>CS 124, Fall 2021<br>
Labs 13: Hangman Continued</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>For the final two labs of the semester, you will continue working on the
Hangman game that was begun in <a href="index.html">Lab&nbsp;12</a>
(or on your alternative project, if that's what you decided to do).
This week, you will implement the actual game logic.  In
<a href="part3.html">Part&nbsp;3</a> of the lab, you should just
be adding polish.</p>

<h3>Word List</h3>

<p>You should already have the GUI for your program pretty much ready to go.  The next part of the
project is to implement the game logic.  That is, you should make it possible for the user
to play the game.</p>

<p>First of all, you will need a list of possible words for the game.  Your program
should read the list of words from a text file that is part of the program.  The file
<a href="wordlist.txt" style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs124_Eck/wordlist.txt</a> is
the same list of 404 words that was used in <a href="../lab6/index.html">Lab&nbsp;6</a>;
however, the first line of the file, which contained the number of words, has been
removed.
Note that all words in the list are 12 characters long or less,
so your program does not have to accommodate words longer than 12 characters.
You also have the option of using your own list of words.</p>

<p>The list of words should be part of the program.  A file that is actually part of a
program is called a <i>resource file</i>.  To include the word list as a resource file,
the file <i>wordlist.txt</i> must be added to the <i>src</i> folder of your project.
However, you will still need a way to read the data from the file.  There is
a not-very-pretty API for reading general resource files.  Here is a method
that you can use in your program to read the file:</p>

<pre class="code">
/**
 * Reads a list of words from a file.
 * @param filename the name of the resource file
 * @return an ArrayList containing the list of words read.
 */
private ArrayList&lt;String> readWordList(String filename) {
    try {
        ArrayList&lt;String> words;
        Scanner in;
        in = new Scanner(getClass().getClassLoader()
                            .getResource(filename).openStream());
        words = new ArrayList&lt;String>();
        while (in.hasNext()) {
            words.add(in.next());
        }
        in.close();
        return words;
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Can't read " + filename);
    }
}
</pre>

<p class=np>Using this method, youc an call <i>readWordList</i>("wordlist.txt") to read the file and get the list
of words for the program in an ArrayList.  Both <i>ArrayList</i> and <i>Scanner</i> will
have to be imported into your program.  When starting a game, select a random
word from the list.  Note that the words from my list are lower-case.  You might
want to convert to upper-case.</p>

<p>It can be convenient to have the characters from the word in an array instead of in a string.
Once you have gotten a word from the list, I suggest that you make an array of type <i>char</i>[]
of the same length as the word and copy all the characters from the word
into the array.  (Actually, a <i>String</i> already has an instance method for
making such an array; use it if you can find it.)  It would also be convenient to have an array
of the same length to hold the letters guessed so far, with some character, such
as an underscore, to hold the places of letters that have not yet been guessed.
</p>

<h3> Game Logic</h3>

<p>As you make progress on your GUI, you can start adding in the implementation of the 
game logic. That is, you should make it possible for the user
to play the game.   Almost all of the game action, except for some setup in the
<i>start</i>() method, takes place in the event handler methods for the buttons (or menu items).</p>

<p>You will need to store some global state data for the game.
This includes, for example, the list of words, the buttons, the word that the user is trying to
guess, the number of incorrect guesses that
the user has made, and maybe a boolean variable to record whether or not the game is over.
Remember that global data are stored in instance variables.  The values of the state variables change
in response to events, and they are used (by a <i>draw</i>() method or otherwise) to decide what
to draw.  You should carefully analyze what has to happen in your event handlers and what
needs to be displayed, based on the state of the game, at any given time both during a game 
and when a game is over.</p>
