<h2>CPSC 124, Spring 2021:
Sample Answers to Quiz #??</h2>

<p class=info><i>These are sample answers only.<br>
Other answers might receive full credit.</i><p>

<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 1.</b>
Give the names of <b>two</b> of Java's <i>primitive types</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b> int and char.
</p>
<p>(There are only 8 primitive types, and those 8 types are the only correct
answers:  byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.  Note that
all primitive type names start with lower case letters.  Note that String
is a type, but it is not a primitive type.)</p>
</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 2.</b>
What is meant by a <i>literal</i> in a program, and
what is the difference between a literal and its value.  (An example might help.)
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
A literal is a sequence of characters in a program that represent some constant
value.  For example, 'A'&nbsp;is a literal of type char that represents the
character&nbsp;A.  When the program is compiled, what's actually in the program 
is the integer 65 expressed as
a 16-bit binary number: 0000000010000001.  The quote marks in 'A' are part
of the literal&mdash;you need to type them into your program to express the
value&mdash;but they are not part of the value that is represented by
the literal.</p>

<p>And 17 is a literal of type byte
that is stored in the computer as the 8-bit binary number 00010001
"Hello" is a literal of type String that represents the
string value consisting of the letters H, e, l, l, and&nbsp;o, actually
stored in the computer as a sequence of binary number.  Again, the
quotation marks are not part of the value.</p>

 
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 3.</b>
Give the value of each of the following expressions.
Assume that <i>str</i> is a variable of type <i>String</i> and that its
value is <code>"programming"</code>.
</p>
<pre>
          str.length() is ______________________

          str.charAt(4) is ______________________

          str.substring(3,7) is ______________________
</pre>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
</p>
<pre>
          str.length() is   <b>11</b>

          str.charAt(4) is   <b>'r'</b>

          str.substring(3,7) is   <b>"gram"</b>
</pre>
<p>(This question is about the specific string "programming", which is the value of
the variable <i>str</i>.  There are eleven characters in "programming", numbered from 0 to 10,
so the answer to the first part is 11.  Character number 4 is 'r', so that is the answer
to the second part.  (I include the quote marks, since the value is of type char.)
The value of <i>str.substring</i>(3,7) is a substring of "programming" consisting of
character number 3 through character 6.  Note that character number 7 is not included.
More generally, <i>str.substring</i>(<i>start,end</i>) is the substring starting with the
character at index number <i>start</i> and ending with the character at index number
(<i>end</i>&minus;1).  Note that if <i>start</i> is 0, then <i>end</i> is the number of characters
in the substring.  The number of characters in the substring is always
(<i>start</i>&minus;<i>end</i>).)</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 4.</b>
Add some Java code to the following program outline, so that it will do the
following:  Ask the user to enter a number, read the user's input, and
print the square root of the number.</p>

<pre>
          import textio.TextIO;
          public class FindRoot;
              public static void main(String[] args) {
          
              }
          }
</pre>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
</p>
<pre>
          import textio.TextIO;
          public class FindRoot;
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                  double input; // The user's input number.
                  double root;  // The square root of the input number.
                  System.out.println("Enter a number:");
                  input = TextIO.getlnDouble();
                  root = Math.sqrt(input);
                  System.out.println("The square root is " + root);
              }
          }
</pre>
