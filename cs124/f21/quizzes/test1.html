<h2>CPSC 124, Spring 2021:
Sample Answers to the First Test</h2>

<p class=info><i>These are sample answers only.  Often, answers that are less<br>
detailed than the ones given here can still receive full credit.</i><p>

<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 1.</b>
What does the computer do to execute the assignment statement&nbsp; <code>x = 3*y + 7;</code>
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
The computer will fetch the value from the memory location that was assigned to
the variable <i>y</i>.  It will multiply that
value by 3, and then add 7 to the value.  It will store the answer in the memory location
of the variable&nbsp;<i>x</i>.
</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 2.</b>
What is the value of the Java expression&nbsp; <code>(742 % 100) / 10</code>&nbsp;? Why?
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
The value is 4.  The value of <code>742 % 100</code> is the remainder when 742 is divided by 10,
which is 42.  Then, <code>42&nbsp;/&nbsp;10</code> is the integer quotient when 42 is divided by
10, discarding the fractional part, which is&nbsp;4.
</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 3.</b>
Define the term <i>algorithm</i>, and explain why it plays such an important
role in computer science.
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
An algorithm is an unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for performing some task (usually also required
to complete after a finite number of steps).  A computer program is the implementation of some
algorithm.  Algorithms are the central study of computer science &mdash; how to write them, how
to make them more efficient, how to prove they are correct, what can be done by them.
</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 4.</b>
To work with Java programs on the command line, you have used the commands
<i>javac</i> and <i>java</i>.  Explain briefly what each of these commands does.
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
<i>javac</i> is a compiler.  It translates a Java program into the machine language for the
java virtual machine.  If you apply it to a Java file, MyProgram.java, with a
command such as <i>javac&nbsp;MyProgram.java</i>, then you get
a .class file, <i>MyProgram.class</i> containing the compiled program.  The <i>java</i>
command is an interpreter that can be used to run the machine language program in a .class file, 
with a command such as <i>java&nbsp;MyProgram</i>.

<p><b>Question 5c.</b>
Suppose that <i>jacksAge</i> and <i>jillsAge</i> are variables of type <i>int</i> that
already have values, and the values give Jack's age and Jill's age.  Write a program segment that
will test their ages and print the correct message, either  "Jack is older", "Jill is older",
or "Jack and Jill are the same age".

<p><b>Question 6.</b>
Draw the picture that is produced when the following code segment is executed:
</p>
<pre>
    int x, y, i;
    x = 0;
    y = 10;
    for ( i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++ ) {
        g.strokeRect(x,0,y,y);
        x = x + y;
        y = y + 10;
    }
</pre>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:110px"><img src="question6-answer.png" width=393 height=146></p>
<p>The value of <i>y</i> is used as the width and height of the rectangle that is drawn (so it is
a square).  The value of <i>y</i> starts at 10, and the first rectangle is 10-by-10.  But the
value of <i>y</i> goes up by 10 every time through the loop, so each square is 10 pixels bigger
than the previous square.  The <i>for</i> loop runs 5 times, so there are 5 squares, and their
sizes will be 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.  The only remaining question is where they are placed.
The second parameter in <code>g.strokeRect(x,0,y,y)</code> is zero, so the tops of
all the rectangles line up, with y-coordinate zero.  The x-coordinate starts out
at zero.  Each time through the loop, the value of <i>y</i> is added to <i>x</i>, which moves
each rectangle horizontally exactly to the right edge of the previous rectangle. The best thing
to do is to just go through the loop and keep track of the values of the variables:</p>
<pre>
         x         y      the rectangle
      --------  -------  ----------------------------
         0         10      g.strokeRect(0,0,10,10)
         10        20      g.strokeRect(10,0,20,20)
         30        30      g.strokeRect(30,0,30,30)
         60        40      g.strokeRect(60,0,40,40)
        100        50      g.strokeRect(100,0,50,50)

<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 10.</b>
Two important aspects of programming languages are <i>syntax</i> and <i>semantics</i>.
Explain these two terms.  As part of your answer, give a specific example of a syntax error in
Java and a specific example of a semantic error in Java.
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
Syntax refers to the "grammar" of the language.  It is the set of rules that determine what is
legal in the language.  For Java, a program with correct syntax can be compiled.  If
the program has a syntax error, the compiler will report the error and refuse to compile the
program.  For example, if a program says, <code style="white-space:pre">if x > y</code> that
is a syntax error because an <i>if</i> statement must have parentheses around the test.</p>
<p>Semantics refers to the "meaning" of a language.  For Java, the semantics
determines what the program does when it is run.  A semantic error doesn't stop the program from
running, but it will give incorrect results.  For example, if a program says 
<code style="white-space:pre">if (x > y)</code>, but the programmer actually wanted to test
whether x is less than y, then that would be a semantic error.
