<h2>CPSC 124, Spring 2021:
Sample Answers to Quiz #1</h2>

<p class=info><i>These are sample answers only.</i><p>

<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 1.</b>
What is a CPU (Central Processing Unit)?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
The CPU is the part of the computer that actually executes machine language instructions.
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 2.</b>
An important part of a computer is the <i>main memory</i> (or <i>RAM</i>),
which holds programs and data.  What is the <b>structure</b> of main memory?  (What is it made up of?
What does it "look like?")
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
The main memory of a computer consists of a numbered sequence of locations, holding binary numbers.  
Each location stores one byte (that is, eight bits).  The number of a location is called its
address and is used to refer to a particular value in memory.
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 3.</b>
What is a significant difference between a <i>machine language</i>
and a <i>high-level programming language</i>?  [Several answers are possible.]
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
Some possible answers...</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine language is executed directly; high-level language has to be translated into
machine language before it can be executed.
<li>Machine language is written in binary numbers; high-level language is written in a 
language closer to human language.
<li>Machine language instructions only do very simple things; high-level langauge
instructions can be more complex.
</ul>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 4.</b>
What is accomplished if the command&nbsp; <code>javac MyProg.java</code>&nbsp; is used
on the command line?
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
MyProg.java must be a program written in the Java programming language.  This command
checks the program for syntax errors and, if there are no errors,
compiles that program, producing the
file MyProg.class, which contains the program translated into the machine language 
of the Java Virtual Machine.  The program can then be run with the command
<code>java&nbsp;MyProg</code>.
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 5.</b>
What does the following Java statement mean?  (What does it accomplish? What are
"answer", "x", and "y"?)
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
This is an assignment statement; <i>answer</i>, <i>x</i>, and <i>y</i> must be 
variables that have been declared earlier in the program.  When the computer
executes this statement, it reads the values of the variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
from memory, adds those values, and stores the result of the computation in 
the variable <i>answer</i>.</p>
