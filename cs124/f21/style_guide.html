<h2>Some Style Rules for Java Programming</h2>

<p><font size="+2">C</font>OMPUTER PROGRAMS should be written so that
they can be read, understood, and modified by human readers.  Programming
<i>style</i> is important, and most programs are
evaluated for style as well as for correctness.  This page lists some basic
programming style rules that you should keep in mind as you write your
programs.  The rules for methods and for classes will only be applicable
after those topics have been covered in class.</p>

<table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=center width="100%">
<tr>
   <td align=right valign=top>
      <span class="category">The Main Rule</span>
   </td>
   <td><b>0.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      A program should be readable.  All the other rules on this page
      can be overridden by this primary rule.  Your programs should
      display good taste, which you can generally acquire only by
      paying attention to the practices of other, expert programmers.
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td align=right valign=top>
      <span class="category">Comments</span>
   </td>
   <td><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every class (except for anonymous inner classes)
   should have a Javadoc comment that specifies the purpose of the class and describes 
   its public interface in general terms.  The main comment for a class should include your name.
   </td>
</tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every method, unless it is declared <tt>private</tt>,
   should have a Javadoc comment explaining what it does.  The comment should include
   a statement of any conditions that must
   hold when the method is called, such as restrictions on the acceptable values
   of its parameters.  (These are called the "preconditions" of the
   method.)  The purpose of each parameter should be clearly documented.
   If there is a return value, its meaning should be documented.  If the method
   can throw any exceptions, it's a good idea to document those as well.  You
   are encouraged to use <tt>@param</tt>, <tt>@return</tt>, and <tt>@throws</tt> tags
   for the relevant documentation.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every variable that has a non-trivial
   role in the program should have a comment that explains its purpose.
   This includes both member variables and local variables.  For non-private
   member variables, the comments should be in Javadoc format.
   For-loop variables and other local utility variables do not, in general,
   have to be commented.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments can be included in
   the body of a method when they are needed to explain the logic
   of the code.  In general, well-written code needs few comments.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments should <i>never</i> be
   used to explain the Java language.  A comment such as "declare an int
   variable named x" or "increment the variable ct" is worse than useless.
   Assume that your reader knows Java!
   (Note that such comments are sometimes used in programming textbooks
   or on the blackboard, but never in real programs.)
   </td></tr>
<tr>
   <td align=right valign=top>
      <span class="category">Formatting</span>
   </td>
   <td><b>6.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use indentation to display the structure
   of your program.  The body of a class definition should be indented.
   The body of a method definition should be indented.
   When a statement is nested inside another statement, it should be indented
   one additional level. (Note that Eclipse can fix the indentation of any segment of
   code:  Just highlight the code segment and hit Control-I.)
   </td>
</tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>7.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;An ending "}" should be on a line
   by itself.  The opening "{" can be at the end of a line, or it can be
   placed on a line by itself so that it lines up with the matching "}".
   I prefer the first of these two options, but whichever one you use,
   <i>be consistent</i>.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>8.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't put more that one statement
   on a line.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>9.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid very long lines.  In general,
   lines should not be longer than 80 characters.  Longer statements should
   be broken up over several lines.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>10.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid very deep nesting of statements.
   If you find yourself using more than two or three levels of nesting,
   think about defining some subroutines in order to break up your code into
   more manageable chunks.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>11.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank spaces and blank lines can
   make a program easier to read.  In general, you should put some blank lines between
   method definitions.  Leave spaces around operators such as =,
   ==, !=, and so on.
   </td></tr>
<tr>
   <td align=right valign=top>
      <span class="category">Naming</span>
   </td>
   <td><b>12.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use meaningful names for your variables,
   methods, and classes.
   </td>
</tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>13.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow
   the usual Java convention for capitalization:  Variable, method, and package names begin
   with lower case letters.  Class names begin with upper case letters.
   When a name contains more than one word, capitalize the extra words,
   as in "interestRate".  
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>14.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use "final static" to declare
   named constants to represent constant data.  Consider using
   "enum" to create several related constants.  Constants generally
   have names that are entirely in upper case, with words separated by
   underscore characters.
   </td></tr>
<tr>
   <td align=right valign=top>
      <span class="category">Methods</span>
   </td>
   <td><b>15.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A method should have a clear, single,
   identifiable task.
   </td>
</tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>16.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual method definition should
   not be too long.  In general, a function should not be longer than
   one printed page (and that is stretching it).
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>17.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Instance methods can access the instance
   variables that represent the state of an object, but you should avoid using 
   instance variables simply to pass information from one method to another -- for
   that, you should use parameters and return values.
   </td></tr>
<tr>
   <td align=right valign=top>
      <span class="category">Classes</span>
   </td>
   <td><b>18.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A class should represent a clear, single,
   identifiable concept.
   </td>
</tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>19.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the modifiers <tt>public</tt>,
   <tt>protected</tt>, and <tt>private</tt> to control access to the variables
   and methods in a class.
   </td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td><b>20.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Member variables should, in general,
   be declared to be private.  Getter and setter methods can be provided to 
   access and manipulate the private member variables.
   </td></tr>
