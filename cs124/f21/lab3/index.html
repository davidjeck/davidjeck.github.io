<h2>CS 124, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 3: While and If</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>In this lab, you will use two of Java's "control structures": while loops and if statements.
<b>You should use only while and if in this lab, even if you know about other control
structures such as for loops!</b></p>

<p>You should try to finish the first two exercises during the lab period.  They
are similar to the kind of short example that we covered in class.  The third
exercise is more complicated.  You should think about it and spend some time developing
an algorithm for the program, before you try to start writing code.  We will
do examples of algorithm development in class on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The programs for this lab do not use any input from the user, and you do not
need TextIO.  Also, there is no JavaFX graphics in this lab, just regular text output.
You will create three programs from scratch.</p>

<p><b>As usual, your work for this lab is due at the start of lab next Tuesday.</b>
You should put your work for this lab in a directory named lab3, and you should
submit your work by copying that folder into your homework folder in
<span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs124_Eck/homework</span>.</p>

<p><b>Don't forget to follow style rules!</b></p>

<h3>Exercise 1: Estimating Pi</h3>

<p>For this exercise, you will write a program that estimates the value of pi using random
numbers.  The next three paragraphs explain why the estimate works, but to write the program,
it's not really necessary to understand the explanation.  The name of the program can
be <i>EstimatePi</i>.</p>

<p><img align=right style="margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:15px" width=104 height=116 src="pi.png">
The diagram on the right shows a quarter circle with radius equal to one.  A full circle
with radius one has area equal to the mathematical constant pi, so the quarter circle
has area pi/4.  The quarter circle is inside a square with side one.  The area of the
square is one.  Suppose that you pick a random point (x,y) in the square.  It might or
might not be inside the circle.  The equation for the circle is 
<span style="white-space:pre">x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> = 1</span>, and the point
(x,y) is inside the circle if <span style="white-space:pre">x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> &lt; 1</span>.</p>

<p>If you pick a large number of random points in the square, the fraction of those points that lie
inside the quarter-circle will be pi/4, because that is the fraction of the area of the square that
is in the quarter-circle.</p>

<p>If the number of random points that you pick is <i>totalCount</i> and the number of points that
lie in the quarter-circle is <i>insideCount</i>, then we can expect that the fraction
<i style="white-space:pre">insideCount/totalCount</i> is approximately equal to pi/4,
and <i style="white-space:pre">(4.0*insideCount)/totalCount</i> is an approximation for&nbsp;pi.</p>

<p><b>Your assignment is to write a program to implement this idea</b>: Generate
a large number of random points (x,y), where x and y are random numbers in the range zero to one.
Count the number of times that <span style="white-space:pre">x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> &lt; 1</span>.
After that is done, the estimate for pi is <i style="white-space:pre">(4.0*insideCount)/totalCount</i>.
To print out the results, the last two lines of the <i>main</i>() routine in your program should be:</p>

<pre class=code>
System.out.printf( "The actual value of Pi is: %1.6f%n", Math.PI );
System.out.printf( "The estimate for Pi is:    %1.6f%n", estimateForPi );
</pre>

<p>Recall that we covered basic "counting loops" in class.  To repeat something <i>totalCount</i>
times, you can use a loop of the form</p>

<pre class=code>
count = 0;
while ( count &lt; totalCount ) {
    .
    .  // do something
    .
    count = count + 1;
}
</pre>

<p>You should run your program for a total count of 100,000,000.  It will take a few seconds.
(If you are willing to wait ten times as long for an answer, try it for 1,000,000,000.)</p>

<h3>Exercise 2:  Six Heads</h3>

<p>For this exercise, you must create a <i>String</i> of 80 H's and T's, where each
character is chosen at random.  You will then check whether the string contains a
string of 6 consecutive H's.  This simulates flipping a coin 80 times and checking
whether there is any time when the coin comes up Heads six times in a row.
The program for this exercise can be called <i>SixHeads</i>.</p>

<p>You will need another counting loop to count the 80 coin flips.  Note that
you can add a character, <i>ch</i>, onto a string, <i>str</i>, by saying</p>

<pre class=code>
str = str + ch;
</pre>

<p class=np>But hopefully, you be using better variable names than "str" and "ch"!
You need to think about what the initial value of the string should be.
What should it be, before you have added any letters onto it?
And note that you can use <i>str.indexOf</i>(<tt>"HHHHHH"</tt>) to test whether HHHHHH
occurs in <i>str</i>.  The value of this expression is &minus;1
if HHHHHH does <b>not</b> occur in <i>str</i>.</p>
</p>

<p>At the end of the program, you should print out the string of 80 H's and T's, and 
you should report the results
of the test.  For example:</p>

<pre class=code>
THTHTTTHHHHHHHHTTTHHHTHHHTTHHHTHTTTHTHTHTHTTTHHHHTTHHTTTHHHHHTHHTTTTHHHTHTHHHHHT
HHHHHH does occur in the string.
</pre>

<p class=np>The probability that HHHHHH occurs is somewhere close to 1/2.  (You
could get a little extra credit if you write an <i>additional</i> program that
runs the same experiment &mdash; without printing anything &mdash; 1,000,000 times
and reports the fraction of experiments in which the string contained HHHHHH.)

<h3>Exercise 3: Simulated Baseball Game</h3>

<p>The program for the third exercise will simulate a baseball game (in a very simple and
unrealistic sense).  The name of the program can be
<i>Baseball</i>.</p>

<p>A baseball game consists of a series of "innings".
In each inning, two teams get a chance to score "runs".  At the end of the
game, the team that has the highest total score wins.  
Usually, there are nine innings, but there are some complications:
First, if the score is tied at the end of the ninth or later inning,
the game continues.  The game can only end when one team is ahead.
There is no limit on how many innings there can be.
Second, in the ninth inning, if the home team (the one 
that goes second in the inning) is ahead in the middle of the 
inning, then the game ends at that point, since giving the home team
a chance to score at that point cannot make any difference to the
outcome.  This can only happen in the ninth inning.</p>


<p>The program will
simulate what happens in a game, but it will just be making up random
numbers of runs for each team; it won't actually simulate individual
players or at-bats.  Here is sample output from one run of the completed
program:</p>

<pre class = code>
 Inning number 1
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 0 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 0 to Red Sox 0

 Inning number 2
    The Yankees score 5 runs
    The Red Sox score 0 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 0

 Inning number 3
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 0 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 0

 Inning number 4
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 1 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 1

 Inning number 5
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 0 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 1

 Inning number 6
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 2 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 3

 Inning number 7
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 0 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 3

 Inning number 8
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 0 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 3

 Inning number 9
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 3 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 6


 The final score is Yankees 5 to Red Sox 6
 The Red Sox win.
</pre>

<p class=np>Another possible ending for the game is:</p>

<pre class = code>
 Inning number 9
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    the Red Sox score 2 runs
 The score is tied 5 to 5, so the game continues

 Inning number 10
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    the Red Sox score 0 runs
 The score is tied 5 to 5, so the game continues

 Inning number 11
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    the Red Sox score 4 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 9


 The final score is Yankees 5 to Red Sox 9
 The Red Sox win.
</pre>

<p class=np>And yet another is:</p>

<pre class = code>
 Inning number 8
    The Yankees score 0 runs
    The Red Sox score 5 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 5 to Red Sox 8

 Inning number 9
    The Yankees score 2 runs
 The total score is now Yankees 7 to Red Sox 8
 The game ends because the Red Sox are ahead.


 The final score is Yankees 7 to Red Sox 8
 The Red Sox win.
</pre>

<p>The output of your program should be similar (maybe using different team names).
You should show the number of runs scored in each inning.
At the end, you should say who won. And you should take into 
account all of the ways that the game might end.  One way to organize
your program is to use two loops, one after the other, the first loop for the first 9 innings and the second loop 
for any extra innings.  It is also possible to do it all in one loop,
but you will need to be a little more clever about determining when the loop
should end.</p>

<p>Note that in baseball, the most common number of runs in an
inning is zero, and large numbers of run are unlikely.  The web page</p>

<p class=np style="text-align:center"><a href="https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/baseball/runsperinning.html">https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/baseball/runsperinning.html</a></p>

<p class=np>has some statistics on the number of runs scored in individual innings
in actual games.  For example in over 70% of innings, a team scores zero runs.
<b>For full credit for this exercise</b>, your program should at least
make zero the most likely number of runs that a team can score in an inning.
If you can do an especially good job of making the distribution of runs more
realistic, you might get a little extra credit.</p>
