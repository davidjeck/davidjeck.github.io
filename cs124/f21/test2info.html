<h2>CS 124-02, Fall 2021<br>
Information on the Second Test</h2>

<p>The second test for this course takes place in class on 
Monday, November&nbsp;1.  The material for the test includes
everything that we have covered from the textbook, up through
Section&nbsp;5.2.  There will <b>not</b> be any questions that are
specifically about material that was covered on the first test.
But of course you still need to know how to use the basics: types, 
variables, assignment statements, control structures, and arrays.
The format will be similar to the
first test.  Questions can incude programming problems, definitions,
questions that ask you read and understand some code,
and essay-type questions.</p>

<p>The main topics for the test are subroutines, classes, and objects.
I will certainly ask you to write one or two subroutines.
I might give you a subroutine or a class and ask you to use it
or explain what it does.  However, I will not ask you to
write a complete class.  There will be no questions on this test that
use JavaFX or any kind of graphics.  Also, <i>ArrayLists</i>
and the <i>Random</i> class will not be on the test.</p>

<p>From the textbook, the test covers all of Sections 4.1 through 4.4.
We did not cover any part of Section&nbsp;4.5.  We only covered certain
things from Sections 4.6 through 4.8.  From Section 4.6,
you only need to be aware of packages and Javadoc.  From Section 4.7,
you should know something about preconditions and postconditions.  From
Section 4.8, you should know about the <i>final</i> modifier, named 
constants, and combining initialization of variables with their
declaration.  We covered all of sections 5.1 and 5.2</p>


<p>Here are some things you should know about:</p>
<hr>
<pre style="margin-left: 1cm">
black box
implementation of a black box
interface of a black box
how black boxes help to manage complexity
subroutines as black boxes
the idea of modularity.

subroutines (also known in Java as "methods")
writing subroutines:  the syntax for subroutine definitions
the access modifiers public and private
return type of a subroutine
void
parameter list of a subroutine
calling a subroutine; what the computer does when it executes a subroutine call statement
formal parameters in a subroutine definition (also called dummy parameters)
actual parameters (in a subroutine call statement)
type rules for actual parameters
how actual parameters are passed into a subroutine
local variables in subroutines
global variables
functions (subroutines that return a value)
returning a value from a function
calling a function and using its return value
the return statement in a function:  return &lt;value&gt;;
type rules for the return value of a function
using a return statement in a void subroutine
throwing exceptions in subroutines
IllegalArgumentException
using subroutines with arrays: arrays as parameters and return values

preconditions, postconditions, and how they are used to reason about programs
Javadoc comments and why they are used
packages; what it means for a class to be in a package
importing classes from a package

combining declaration with initialization; for example:   int x = 17;
final variables
named constants and the reasons for using them

classes and objects
the relationship between classes and objects
creating objects from classes with "new"
instance of a class (an object created from that class)
instance variables and instance methods 
static versus non-static
static things are part of the class
non-static things don't exist until an object is created, and each object gets its own copy
instance variables: the non-static global variables in a class
instance methods:  the non-static methods in a class
how the non-static part of a class is used when objects are created from the class
pointers to objects (also called references)
null
classes are types, so can be used to declare variables, return types, and parameter types
arrays of objects; an object type can be the base type of an array
when an array is created, whose base type is an object type, all values in the array are null
declaring a variable (of object type) does not create an object
a variable (of object type) can never hold an object, only a pointer to an object
an assignment statement applied to objects will only copy a pointer, not an object
testing pointers to objects with == and != tests whether they point to the same object
controlling access to instance variables by making them private
getters and setters and why they are used
the toString() method in a class
constructors
how to recognize constructors in a class definition
parameters in constructors
calling constructors with "new"
