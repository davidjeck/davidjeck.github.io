<h2>CPSC 124, Fall 2021:<br>
Sample Answers to Final Exam Study Guide Questions</h2>


<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 1.</b>
Some short programming exercises...
</p>
<p><b>a)</b>&nbsp;  Use a <b>for</b> loop to print out all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 100,
with each number on a separate line.
<p><b>b)</b>&nbsp;  Write a program segment that gets an integer from the user in the
range 1 to 100 (inclusive).  Use a <b>while</b> loop to make sure that the
number that you get is actually in the specified range. (You can use <i>TextIO</i>
for input.)
<p><b>c)</b>&nbsp;  Write a program segment that simulates rolling a pair of dice 1,000,000
times and counts how many times the dice come up doubles (that is, how many times
the values on the two dice are the same).
<p><b>d)</b>&nbsp;  Write a code segment to simulate the following experiment:
Toss a coin over and over, until it has come up <i>heads</i> ten times.
At the end, print the number of times that the coin has come up <i>tails</i>.

<p><b>Question 3.</b>
The following code, although syntactically correct,
has two semantic errors that would cause exceptions at run time. The
intent is to create five buttons that are initially disabled.  Find
the two errors and state the problem in each case.
</p>
<pre>
Button[] buttons;
buttons = new Button[5];
for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
   buttons[i].setDisable(true);
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
There would be a null pointer exception for "buttons[i].setDisable(true);"
because no <i>Buttons</i> have been created.  When the array is created, it
is filled with <i>null</i>, so <i>buttons</i>[<i>i</i>] is <i>null</i>.
</p>
<p>Once that problem is fixed, there would be an index out of bounds exception when <i>i</i> is&nbsp;5,
since the only valid indices for the array are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  The for loop
should use "<i>i</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;5", not "<i>i</i>&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5".

<div class="question">
<p><b>Question 4.</b>
Writing subroutines...
</p>

<p><b>a)</b>&nbsp;  Write a subroutine to count the number of times that the
number 17 occurs in an array of type <i>int</i><code>[]</code>.  (The array
should be a parameter; the return value is the count.)

<p><b>b)</b>&nbsp;  Write a subroutine named <i>containsAll</i> with return type <i>boolean</i> and
two parameters of type <i>String</i>.  The value of <i>containsAll</i>(<i>str, chars</i>)
should be <i>true</i> if the string <i>str</i> contains <b>every</b> character in the string <i>chars</i>.
(You will need to use either nested <i>for</i> loops or the string method <i>indexOf</i>.)

<p><b>c)</b>&nbsp;  Write a subroutine that will strip extra spaces from a string.  The parameter
of the subroutine is a <i>String</i>.  The return value is the same string, except
that every substring of consecutive spaces has been replaced by a single space.
For example, using ~ to represent a space, if the parameter is 
<code style="white-space:pre">"Goodby~~~ cruel~~world</code>, then the value returned by the
subroutine is <code style="white-space:pre">"Goodby~cruel~world"</code>.  (Hint: Only include a space in
the output string if the preceding character is not also a space.)

<p><b>Question 10.</b>
Some short essay questions\dots
<p><b>a)</b>&nbsp;  Define the terms <i>syntax</i> and <i>semantics</i> as they relate to programming.
Include some examples in your discussion.
<p><b>b)</b>&nbsp;  Some members of classes are <i>static</i>, and some are not.  Carefully explain
the difference.
<p><b>c)</b>&nbsp;  Discuss the <i>new</i> operator, why it is necessary, and how it relates
to <i>constructors</i>.
<p><b>d)</b>&nbsp;  Describe the <i>binary search</i> algorithm, and explain
briefly why it is so much more efficient than <i>linear search</i>.
<p><b>e)</b>&nbsp;  What does it mean for a variable to be <i>private</i>, and why should
private variables be used?
<p><b>f)</b>&nbsp;  What is an algorithm?  What is the difference between an algorithm and a program?
<p><b>g)</b>&nbsp;  What are <i>pointers</i>, and where are they used in Java?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Answer.</b>
</p>
<p><b>a)</b>&nbsp; 
Syntax refers to the grammar of a language; it determines what is legal in a program.
A program that has syntax errors cannot even be compiled.  An example of a syntax rule
is that every variable must be declared, or that an assignment statement ends with
a semicolon.  Semantics refers to meaning; semantics determines what a program does
when it is run.  A program with semantic errors can be compiled and run, but it won't
produce the desired result.  For example, the semantics of a while loop says that 
the loop will end when the value of the boolean expression in the loop is false.
</p>
<p><b>b)</b>&nbsp; 
The static part of a class defines things that are part of the class itself.  The
non-static part of a class defines things that will be part of objects that are
created from the class using the <i>new</i> operator.  For a static variable, there
is only one copy of the variable, and it exists for the entire time that the program
is running.  For a non-static variable, there is a copy in each object that is
created from the class, and each copy exists only as long as the object that
contains it exists.
</p>
<p><b>c)</b>&nbsp; 
The <i>new</i> operator is used to create objects from a class.  It is the only
way that new objects can be created.  When it is used,
as in the expression <code>new&nbsp;Button("Stop")</code>, memory is allocated in
the heap for the object, and a constructor subroutine in the class is called to
initialize the object.
</p>
<p><b>d)</b>&nbsp; 
Binary search only applies to a sorted list.  In binary search, the item that you
are searching for is compared to the middle item in the list.  If it is less than
that item, all items after the middle item are eliminated.  If it is greater,
all items before the middle item are eliminated.  Then the same procedure is
applied to the remaining list of items, until either the item is found or the
list has shrunk to size zero.  In binary search, each comparison eliminates half
of the remaining list.  In linear search, each comparison eliminates just one
item.  This makes binary search much faster.  For example, if you start with
1000 items, binary search will use at most ten steps, while linear search
could use up to 1000 steps.
</p>
<p><b>e)</b>&nbsp; 
A private instance variable can only be accessed in the class where it is defined.
This protects it from being modified from outside that class, and makes it possible
to be <b>sure</b> that the value of the variable is always legal and makes sense.
</p>
<p><b>f)</b>&nbsp; 
An algorithm is an unambiguous step-by-step procedure for carrying out a certain
task, which is guaranteed to finish in a finite number of steps.  A program is
an expression of an algorithm, implemented in some particular programming language.
The algorithm is the idea behind the program, but the same algorithm could be
implemented in any programming language.
</p>
<p><b>g)</b>&nbsp; 
Variables in Java don't actually store objects; they store pointers to objects.
A pointer to an object is the address of the object in memory; it tells where
the object can be found.  The <i>new</i> operator returns a pointer to the
newly created object, which can be used to access the object whenever it is
used later in the program.
