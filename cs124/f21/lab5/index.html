<h2>CS 124, Fall 2021<br>
Lab 5: Hangman</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>For this lab, you will implement the game of Hangman, which is described below.
You will write the program file, <b>Hangman.java</b>, from scratch.  The program does
not use JavaFX.  However, it does need input from the user.  To use 
<a href="../lab2/lab2-files/textio/TextIO.java">TextIO</a> in your
program, remember that you need to copy the textio directory into same directory
as the program.  You could just copy-and-paste it from your lab2 folder.
Also, remember to put "import textio.TextIO;" at the start of the program.</p>

<p>Please read the Program Requirements and Hints, at the end of this lab, before starting work on
the program!  And please spend some time designing the program before you start
to code.</p>

<p>In the version of the game for this lab, the computer will always use the same word,
which is pretty pointless.  In the next lab, we will see how to add a list of words
for the computer to use.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: line-through">Your work for this lab is due at the start of next week's lab, as usual.  You can
just turn in a copy of the file Hangman.java.  As long as your file is actually named
Hangman.java, there is no need to put the file in
a directory named lab5 (but you can do that if you want).</p>

<p><b style="color:#990000">Change of plan on September 24:</b> You will not turn in the version of Hangman from this lab.
You will improve the program in Lab 6, and only the improved version will be turned in for grading.</p>

<h3>Hangman</h3>

<p>Hangman is a two-person game in which one player picks a secret word, and the other
player tries to guess the letters that occur in the word.  In the computer version,
the computer picks the word, and the user tries to guess it.</p>

<p>Each time the user enters a letter, they are told whether or not it occurs in the
word.  If it does not occur, that counts as a bad guess.  If the user reaches the
maximum allowed number of bad guesses, they lose the game.  They win the game by
guessing all of the letters in the word before reaching the limit on bad guesses.</p>

<p>Here is what the first few moves in a game of Hangman might look like, when it is 
played in a Terminal, with the letters entered by the user shown in red:</p>

<pre class=code>
Let's play Hangman!

The word has 13 letters.

What is your first letter? <b>t</b>
   Yes, the word contains a T.

The word so far:   _ _ _ T _ _ _ _ _ T _ _ _ 

Your previous guesses: T
What is your next letter? <b>e</b>
   Sorry, the word does not contains a E.
   You have now made 1 bad guesses.
   You have 6 guesses left.

The word so far:   _ _ _ T _ _ _ _ _ T _ _ _ 

Your previous guesses: ET
What is your next letter? <b>i</b>
   Yes, the word contains a I.

The word so far:   _ _ _ T _ _ _ I _ T I _ _ 

Your previous guesses: EIT
What is your next letter? <b>s</b>
   Sorry, the word does not contains a S.
   You have now made 2 bad guesses.
   You have 5 guesses left.

The word so far:   _ _ _ T _ _ _ I _ T I _ _ 

Your previous guesses: EIST
What is your next letter? <b>n</b>
   Yes, the word contains a N.

The word so far:   _ _ N T _ _ _ I _ T I _ N 

Your previous guesses: EINST
What is your next letter? <b>r</b>
   Yes, the word contains a R.

The word so far:   _ _ N T R _ _ I _ T I _ N

<h3>Program Requirements and Hints</h3>

<p>You must implement the game fully.  The game ends when the word is complete
or when the user reaches the limit on bad guesses (7 in my program).</p>

<p>You must output the "word so far" in the format shown after each guess.
Use an underscore character followed by a space to represent letters in
the word that have not yet been guessed.  Use the letter followed by a
space if the letter has been guessed.  Other than that, you don't need
to follow the exact format shown above, but you do need to make the
output neat and keep the reader fully informed about what is going on.</p>

<p>This is a preliminary version of the program that always uses the
same word to be guessed by the user.  You should store that word
in a variable.  However, your program must still work if a different
word is stored in the variable.  For example, always refer to the
length of the word as <i>word.length</i>(), and not as a numerical
value such as 13.</p>

<p class=np><b>Hints:</b>
<ul>
<li>You do <b>not</b> need to store a string like
<code style="white-space:pre">_ _ N T _ _ _ I _ T I _ N</code>
in a variable!  You can go through the word and
output the characters one-by-one.</li>
<li>You will need to keep a string that contains all of the 
letters that have been guessed by the user.  Every time the
user enters a letter, add it to that string.</li>
<li>You can use <i>TextIO.getlnChar</i>() to read a single character
into a variable of type <i>char</i>.</li>
<li>It will be easiest if all the letters that you are working
with are in upper case.  You should convert the word to upper
case.  But you shouldn't force the user to enter upper case letters.
If you have a variable of type <i>char</i>, and you
want to convert it to upper case, you can do that with
<i>letter = Character.toUpperCase(letter)</i>.</li>
<li>It is suggested to use a <i>while(true)</i> loop,
and use a <i>break</i> statement to exit the loop when the user
wins or when the user loses.</li>
<li>It is easy to tell when the user loses.  Checking
that the user has won is harder.  You have to figure out 
a way to check whether all of the letters in the word
have been guessed, that is, whether they are all in the
list of guessed letters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things that are not required but might be nice:  If the
user guesses a letter that they have already guessed, you could
just ask them to enter a different letter (and not count it as
a bad guess even if the letter is not in the word).
And you could print out the list of letters-guessed-so-far in
alphabetical order; there was an example in class that showed
pretty much how to do that without actually keeping the list
in alphabetical order.</p>
