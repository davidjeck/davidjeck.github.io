<h3>Final Exam: December 10</h3>

<p>The final exam for this course takes place on Friday, December 10, at 8:30 AM in our regular classroom.</p>

<p>A <a href="f21/finalinfo.pdf">study guide for the exam</a> was handed out in class on December 1.</p>

<p align=center>
<a href="f21/final-study-guide-answers/index.html"><b>SAMPLE ANSWERS FOR STUDY GUIDE QUESTIONS</b></a>

<hr>


<h3>Fifteenth Week: November 29; December 1 and 3</h3>

<p>We will spend the last week of the semester with <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>.
We have already covered parts of this chapter, but there are some examples and language features that are new.
We will spend the most time on <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/s4.html">Section&nbsp;7.4</a>.
which covers searching and sorting and introduces the idea of analyzing and comparing the run times of algorithms.</p>

<p>Friday will be mostly devoted to review for the final exam.</p>

<p>Remember that your <a href="f21/lab12/index.html">final project</a> is due this Friday, December 3.
I expect to print out your programs Saturday morning.</p>  

<hr>


<h3>Fourteenth Week: November 22.</h3>

<p>On Monday, I will discuss keyboard events, along with a little more discussion of events in general.
After that, we will be moving on to Chapter&nbsp;7, which is about arrays and ArrayList. We have already
covered parts of that chapter.  We will spend the rest of the semester covering the rest of it.</p>

<p>There is no class for the rest of the week because of Thanksgiving break.  <b>Happy Thanksgiving!</b></p>





<hr>

<h3>Thirteenth Week: November 15, 17, and 19</h3>

<p>We will finish the material from <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>
and will devote the rest of the week to look at selected topics from
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c6/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>.
Chapter&nbsp;6 covers GUI programming with JavaFX.  We have already done quite a
bit of that, in an unofficial sort of way, but now we will be looking at things more
abstractly and in more detail.  We will not have time to cover everything, so you
should pay attention to what is actually covered in class.  (And read the whole
chapter when you get a chance.)</p>


<hr>

<h3>Twelfth Week: November 8, 10, and 12</h3>

<p>We will spend a little more time on <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s5.html">Section&nbsp;5.5</a>.
For the rest of the week, we will look at topics from the remainder of
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.
The important topics are the special variables <i>this</i> and <i>super</i>
(<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s6.html">Section&nbsp;5.6</a>),
basic <i>interfaces</i> (<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s7.html#OOP.7.1">Subsection&nbsp;5.7.1</a>),
and basic <i>nested classes</i> (<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s8.html#OOP.8.1">Subsection&nbsp;5.8.1</a> and
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s8.html#OOP.8.2">Subsection&nbsp;5.8.2</a>).
I will also be able to say more about <i>lambda expressions</i>, which we have started using
in GUI programs but which I have not really explained.</p>




<hr>

<h3>Eleventh Week: November 1, 3, and 5</h3>

<p>There is a test on Monday, November 1.  A <a href="f21/test2info.html">study guide</a> was
handed out in class on Wednesday, October 27.</p>

<p>After the test on Monday, we will spend the rest of the week on 
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s5.html">Section&nbsp;5.5</a>, which covers
subclasses and inheritance.  This is an important aspect of object-oriented programming, and it
will take some time to cover it.</p>



<hr>

<h3>Tenth Week: October 25, 27, and 29</h3>


<p>There is a quiz this week on Monday, October 25.  The second test will be next Monday, November 1.</p>

<p>The reading for the week is <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s3.html">Section&nbsp;5.3</a> and
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s4.html">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>.  The main topic is
object-oriented programming.  We will look at the Card, Deck, and Hand examples from Section&nbsp;5.4.
We might get into
Section&nbsp;5.5 on Friday, but that section will not be on the test.</p>


<hr>

<h3>Ninth Week: October 18, 20, and 22</h3>

<p>We have started Chapter 5, but have not quite finished 
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s1.html">Section&nbsp;5.1</a>.
We will finish that on Monday and move on to
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s2.html">Section&nbsp;5.2</a>,
which covers constructors.  By Friday, we should get into
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s3.html">Section&nbsp;5.3</a> and
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s4.html">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>,
which are about using classes and objects, but we will continue with those
sections for at least the first part of next week.</p>

<p>There is a quiz on Monday, October 18, covering Chapter 4.
There will be another quiz the following Monday and then a test the week after that.</p>


<hr>

<h3>Eighth Week: October 13 and 15</h3>

<p>We still have to finish up a bit of Chapter 4.  The last three sections of that chapter have
information on a lot of topics, and you are not responsible for all of them.
You are responsible for the material in the following subsections:  4.6.1, 4.6,2, 4.6.3, 
4.6.5, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 4.8.1, 4.8.3, and 4.8.4.  We have already covered a lot of that material.</p>

<p>We will then move on to Chapter 5, which introduces object-oriented programming. You should read
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s1.html">Section&nbsp;5.1</a>, which covers central ideas
about objects and their relationship to classes.  We might start Section&nbsp;5.2 on Friday.</p>

<p>There is no lab this week.  The work from last week's
<a href="f21/lab7/index.html">lab</a> is due next week.</p>

<p>You can expect another quiz next Monday.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Seventh Week: October 4, 6, and 8</h3>

<p>There is a quiz at the start of class on Monday of this week.</p>

<p>We are working on <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c4/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>, which
covers writing subroutines and using them to construct more complex programs.  The new reading for
the week is <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c4/s3.html">Section&nbsp;4.3</a>, and
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c4/s4.html">Section&nbsp;4.4</a>.  Sections 4.2 through 4.4
cover all the basic aspects of writing subroutines, including parameters and return values.
Global and local variables are also covered.  We will also be discussing how to use subroutines to build complex
programs, which covers some of the material from Section&nbsp;4.6.</p>

<p>Next week is Fall Break.  There is no class on Monday and no lab on Tuesday.
And there will not be a quiz next week.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Sixth Week: September 27 and 29; October 1</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>,
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c4/s1.html">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>, and
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c4/s2.html">Section&nbsp;4.2</a>.
Section&nbsp;3.8 introduces arrays.  The <a href="f21/lab6/index.html">lab</a> on Tuesday will be about arrays
but, just as important, will introduce the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
We will them move on to Chapter&nbsp;4, which is about writing your own subroutines.</p>

<p>There is no lab work due this week.  The work from Labs 5 and&nbsp;6 will
all be due on October 7.  And there is no quiz on Monday. However, you
can expect another quiz next Monday, October&nbsp;7.</p>



<hr>

<h3>Fifth Week: September 20, 22, and 24</h3>

<p>There is a <b>test</b> this week, on Friday.  <a href="f21/test1info.pdf" style="white-space:pre">Click here for a study guide</a>.
A copy of the study guide will be handed out in class on Monday.</p>

<p>The reading for the week is <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s6.html">Section&nbsp;3.6</a>
and <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s7.html">Section&nbsp;3.7</a>.  In fact, we already
covered the <code>switch</code> statement from Section&nbsp;3.6 on Friday.  Section&nbsp;3.7 covers
exceptions and the <code>try..catch</code> statement.  Note that none of this material is covered on the test.</p>

<p>We will spend some time on Wednesday reviewing for the test and looking at some sample problems
from past tests.  It is possible that we will start Section&nbsp;3.8, if there is time.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Fourth Week: September 13, 15, and 17</h3>

<p>We will continue looking at control structures this week.  Most important are the <i>for</i>
loop and the form of the <i>if</i> statement that uses <i>else&nbsp;if</i>.
The <i>break</i> statement, which can be used to exit a loop early, is also important.
We will discuss the <i>do..while</i> statement and the <i>switch</i> statement, but they 
are less important.  I will expect you to be able to read and understand code that uses
<i>do..while</i> and <i>switch</i>, but I will not require you to use them in code
that you write yourself.</p>

<p>The reading for the week is Sections 2 through 5 in 
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.
From Section&nbsp;3.2, the main take-away is the idea of <i>algorithm</i>.
(You might want to look at <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s9.html">Section&nbsp;3.9</a>,
which talks about JavaFX.  The material in that section has been covered in labs, and we won't
be spending more time on it in class.)</p>

<p>There is a quiz on Monday this week, and a test coming up at the end of next
week, on Friday, September 24.</p>



<hr>

<h3>Third Week: September 6, 8, and 10</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s1.html">Section&nbsp;3.1</a>
and <a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s5.html">Section&nbsp;2.5</a>.
We will start the week on Monday with Section 3.1, which introduces two of Java's
control structures:  the <i>while</i> loop and the <i>if</i> statement.  We will
look at a number of examples, and you will start using these control structures in
the <a href="f21/lab3/index.html">lab</a> on Tuesday.  We will continue with examples
on Wednesday, but we will start concentrating on how to go about developing a program to carry
out a given task.</p>

<p>Section 2.5 is full of detail about expressions in Java.  It covers many different
"operators" such as %, &gt;=, &amp;&amp;, ++, and&nbsp;+=.  We will cover some of the
most important ones in class, but you should read that section for yourself and use
it as a reference when needed.  (Section 2.6 contains information about using Java.
We will not cover it, and it is not required reading.  It could be useful to you
if you are trying to use Java on your own computer.)</p>

<p>Once again, there is quiz at the start of class on Monday.</p>

<hr>



<h3>Second Week: August 30; September 1 and 3</h3>


<p>The reading for the week is <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s3.html">Section&nbsp;2.3</a>
and <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s4.html">Section&nbsp;2.4</a>.  You can skip
Subsections&nbsp;2.3.4, Subsection&nbsp;2.3.5, and Subsection&nbsp;2.4.4.  We will not cover
the material in any of those sections.  You can also skip Subsection&nbsp;2.4.6 for now, but we
will cover it eventually.</p>

<p>The main topic is
using pre-defined subroutines.  We will look at some of the subroutines defined in class <i>Math</i>,
in class <i>System</i>, and in objects of type <i>String</i>.  These are all standard, built-in parts of
Java.  We will also see how to use input subroutines from <i>TextIO</i>, a class that is not a standard
part of Java.  Many of the subroutines that we will look at are "functions."  That is, they return,
or compute, a value.  The lab on Tuesday will also introduce subroutines from the <i>GraphicsContext</i>
class, which are used to draw shapes on the screen.</p>

<p>There is a quiz on Monday, at the beginning of class, covering Sections 1.1, 1.3, and 2.1.</p>


<hr>



<h3>First Week: August 23, 25, and 27</h3>


<p>Welcome to the course!</p>

<p>You should begin reading the textbook, which is available
on-line at <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes</a>.  Because the first lab
is on Tuesday, we will move very quickly into the most basic aspects of Java programming, which are covered in 
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s1.html">Section&nbsp;2.1</a> and
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s2.html">Section&nbsp;2.2</a>.  
Some of the same information that you need will be provided in the lab, and the work for
the lab is not due until next week, but it would be useful to start reading Chapter&nbsp;2.
</p>

<p>Aside from starting in on Java programming, during the first week of the semester,
we will go over some of the introductory material from <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c1/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> 
of the textbook.  We will cover only a part of Chapter&nbsp;1 in class, but it is a good idea to read the
entire chapter to get a preview of most of the topics that will be covered during the rest of the semester.
However, you should not expect to fully understand everything in Chapter&nbsp;1 at this time.
The most important sections are
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c1/s1.html">Section&nbsp;1.1</a> and
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c1/s3.html">Section&nbsp;1.3</a>.  Those two section give
a brief overview of how computers and Java actually work.  Sections 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6
give short overviews of many of the topics that we will cover in the rest of the semester. It is recommended
that you read them to orient yourself in the course, but they are not required reading.</p>

<p>The required reading for the first week also includes the
