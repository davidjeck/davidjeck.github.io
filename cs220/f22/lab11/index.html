<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
Lab 11: Functions in x86-64 Assembly</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>This lab is about writing and using functions in assembly language.  The lab
has two parts.  In Part&nbsp;A, you will write some functions in assembly language
that are called from a program written in&nbsp;C.  In Part&nbsp;B, you will write an assembly language
program that calls functions from the C standard library.  The two parts of the
lab are completely independent.  You can work on them in either order.</p>

<p>You will need to use the Linux C calling convention, which was summarized in
<a href="../registers.html">this&nbsp;handout</a>.</p>

<p><b>You have the option of working on this lab with a partner of your choice.</b>
Two people working together should submit just <b>one</b> copy of their work, to
the homework folder for either partner.  Both names <b>must</b> be in a comment
at the top of the programs.</p>

<p><b>Work from this lab is due by 3:00 PM next 
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">Friday, November 11</span> 
Monday, November 14 (later than usual
because of the test on Wednesday).  You 
will turn in two assembly language programs named lab11A.asm and lab11B.asm. Copy your files
to your folder in <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220/homework</span></b></p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Part A: Writing Functions in Assembly for Use in C</h3>

<p>For this part of the lab, you should create a new file named <i>lab11A.asm</i> to hold
your assembly language code.  You will write three functions in that file named <i>sum8</i>,
<i>arraySearch</i>, and <i>fibonacci</i>.  These functions will be called from a program
written in&nbsp;C.  To work with that program, they must follow the C calling convention
for passing arguments and returning a value.</p>

<p>The C program that will test your functions is <a href="lab11main.c">lab11main.c</a>, which you can get
from <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220</span> or through the above link.</p>

<p>The functions are declared <i>extern</i> in the C program.  To make them available
for use in that program, you need to declare <i>sum8</i>, <i>arraySearch</i>, and <i>fibonacci</i>
to be <i>global</i> in <i>lab11A.asm</i>.</p>

<p>You can assemble <i>lab11A.asm</i> in the usual way with <i>yasm</i>, to get the
object file <i>lab11A.o</i>.  But to link it with the C program, you will have to 
complile and link it using the <i>gcc</i> compiler and linker.  The command to compile
and link and create an executable program named <i>lab11</i> is:</p>

<pre class=code>
gcc -g -o lab11 lab11main.c lab11A.o
</pre>

<p class=np>You can then use the command <i>./lab11</i> to run the program.  (If you get a
some error mentioning PIE when you use <i>gcc</i>, try using this command instead:</p>

<pre class=code>
gcc -g -no-pie -o lab11 lab11main.c lab11A.o
</pre>

<p class=np>but that should only happen if the assembly language code has a data, rodata, or bss section,
and you don't need those sections for this lab.)</p>

<p><b>Debugging problems.</b> You might want to run the debugger on the program.  It has
become clear that there is a bug in some combination of the <i>yasm</i> assembler and the debugger.
The alternative assembler, <i>nasm</i>, doesn't have the same problem.  If you want to use the
debugger, try assembling your code with <i>nasm</i> using</p>

<pre class=code>
nasm  -felf64  -gdwarf  lab11A.asm
</pre>

<p class=np>Note the use of "-gdwarf" instead of "-gdwarf2"; that is not a typo.  Unfortunately, the syntax rules for
<i>nasm</i> are not quite identical to <i>yasm</i> syntax rules.  It should work, but if you
have problems, ask for help.</p>



<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class=np>Here is a specification of the three functions:</p>

<p><b>First function: sum8(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h).</b>  The first function is simple.  It just adds up its
eight arguments and returns the sum.  It can be implemented with a <i>mov</i> instruction and
eight <i>add</i> instructions.  The problem is knowing where the arguments are, and for that you
need to understand the calling convention.  The arguments and return value are of type <i>long</i>.
(Note: Remember that values on the stack can be accessed relative to the stack pointer, <i>rsp</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Second function: long arraySearch(long A[], long len, long x).</b> This function searches an
array for a given value.  It returns -1 if the value is not in the array, and it returns the
array index of the item if it is found.  The first argument is (a pointer to) the array.
The second is the number of items in the array.  And the third is the item that you are
searching for.</p>

<p><b>Third function: unsigned long fibonacci(unsigned long N).</b>  You should write a recursive
function to compute the Nth Fibonacci number.  (This is a terrible idea, since the recursive 
implementation is horribly inefficient, and you shouldn't call the function for N bigger than
maybe 25 because the run time increases exponentially with&nbsp;N.)  In pseduocode, the
recursive algorithm is:</p>

<pre class=code>
if (N < 2)
   return 1
else
   return fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2)
</pre>

<p class=np>For the recursive case, you will need to save at least one value on the stack.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class=np>Here is what the program should output"</p>

<pre class=code>
sum8(10,-3,7,20,-15,2,15,6) = 42

Is  10 in list1?  yes
Is  42 in list1?  no
Is 636 in list2?  yes
Is -17 in list2?  no
Is 211 in list2?  yes
Is 238 in list2?  yes

Fibonacci(0) is 1
Fibonacci(1) is 1
Fibonacci(2) is 2
Fibonacci(3) is 3
Fibonacci(4) is 5
Fibonacci(5) is 8
Fibonacci(6) is 13
Fibonacci(7) is 21
Fibonacci(8) is 34
Fibonacci(9) is 55

</pre>

<h3>Part B: Calling Standard C Functions</h3>

<p>For this part of the lab, you should create a new file named <i>lab11B.asm</i> to hold
your program.  You will write an assembly language program that is a direct translation
of a program written in&nbsp;C.  The program lets the user play a guessing game.
It is given below and in the file <a href="guessing-game.c">guessing-game.c</a>.
If you would like to try the program before you work on the translation, you
can compile and run it with the commands</p>

<pre class=code>
gcc -o game guessing-game.c
./game
</pre>

<p>The program includes calls to the standard C functions printf, scanf, getchar, time, srand, and rand.
Don't forget to declare those names as <i>extern</i> in your program.  And remember, if you work with
32-bit integer values, use the 32-bit registers such as <i>eax</i>, <i>esi</i>, and <i>r12d</i>.</p>

<p>To compile and link your program, you should use the build script <a href="build.sh">build.sh</a>,
which can be found in <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220</span>.  You can run it 
from that folder:</p>

<pre class=code>
/classes/cs220/build.sh  -c  lab11B.asm
</pre>

<p class=np>You can also copy it into the same directory as lab11B.asm and run it from there:</p>

<pre class=code>
./build.sh  -c  lab11B.asm
</pre>

<p class=np>In any case, don't forget to include the "-c" option.  That option is needed for
the linker to find the C standard libraries.  You will get link errors if you don't include it.</p>

<p>It is possible to use the <i>ddd</i> debugger for this part of the lab, but you should use
the <i>nasm</i> assembler instead of <i>yasm</i> to the avoid the <i>yasm</i> bugs.  To use
<i>nasm</i> with the build script, add the "-n" option:</p>

<pre class=code>
./build.sh  -c  -n  lab11B.asm
</pre>


<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class=np>Here is the program written in C:</p>


<pre class=code>
#include &lt;time.h>
#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>

/* Guessing game.  Computer picks a random number in the range 1 to 100.
 * The user tries to guess it.  The computer tells the user if their guess
 * is high or low.  The user has 6 tries to guess the number.
 */

int main() {

    // initialize the random number generator with the current time.
    unsigned long now = time(0);
    srand(now);
    
    int N = (rand() % 100) + 1; // random number in the range 1 to 100
    
    printf("I picked a number in the range 1 to 100.  Try to guess it.\n\n");
    
    int guessCount = 0;  // Count the user's guesses.
    int userGuess;       // The user's guess;
    
    while (1) {
        guessCount++;
        printf("What is your guess? ");
        int i = scanf("%i", &userGuess);
        if ( i != 1 ) {
            printf("Please enter an integer!\n");
            guessCount--; // don't count this guess
            int ch;
            do { // eat the rest of the input line
               ch = getchar();
            } while (ch != 10);
        }
        else if (userGuess == N) {
           printf("You got it in %d tries.\n", guessCount);
           break;
        }
        else if (guessCount == 6) {
           printf("Sorry, you used up your 6 guesses.\n");
           printf("My number was %i.\n", N);
           break;
        }
        else if (userGuess > N) {
            printf("Too high!  Try again.");
        }
        else {
            printf("Too low!  Try again.");
        }
    }
