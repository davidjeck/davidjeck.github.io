<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
    About the First Test</h2>
<hr noshade>

<p>The first test in CS 220 will be given in class on
Wednesday, September 28.   It will cover almost everything that
we have done through Friday, September&nbsp;23, including
labs.  (Exceptions include the IEEE 754 representation of floating
point numbers and  our discussion of the memory hierarchy and caching.
There will be no questions about using the Larcsim and Logisim programs.)</p>

<p>General topics include:
Java's bitwise logical and shift operators, the Larc computer and its
machine language and assembly language, and logic circuits, including
combinational circuits and memory circuits.  A detailed list of topics
is given below.</p>

<p>The test will be made up of a variety of questions.  There will be some
short answer questions and longer essays, ranging from things as simple as
the meaning of a single assembly language instruction to very general
questions about computers and circuits.  There can be some problems that ask
you to write some Larc assembly language code, or to say what some given
code does.  You might be asked to convert between circuits and Boolean expressions,
or determine what a given circuit does.</p>

<p>You do not have to memorize the Larc machine language or the Larc
assembly language.  You will be given a copy of the class handout containing the
tables of <a href="29Aug-1.pdf"> instructions</a>
and <a href="29Aug-2.pdf">hex&nbsp;digits</a>.

<h3>Sample Questions</h3>
<p>The following questions are meant as examples of questions that might be on the test.  (This is not
meant to be a complete survey of every kind of question that you might encounter on the test.)</p>

<p><b style="font-size:110%; color:darkblue">1.</b>
Suppose that A, B, C, D, and E are <i>int</i> variables in Java, and that the following
assignment statements are executed.  What values are assigned to the variables C, D, and E?  Write your answers
in hexadecimal.
