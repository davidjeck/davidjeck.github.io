<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
Lab 3: Larc Programming, Part 2</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>This is the second of two labs on programming the Larc model computer,
using the <a href="lab3-files/larcsim.jar">Larcsim</a> simulator program.
This lab concentrates on accessing Larc memory with the sw and lw 
instructions,  on implementing subroutines with the jalr 
instructions, and on using strings.  You should have already completed
the <a href="../lab2/index.html">previous&nbsp;lab</a>, and you should
be familiar with the <a href="../larc_ML.html">Larc&nbsp;computer</a>
and <a href="../larcsim.html">Larc&nbsp;simulator</a> documentation.
The first two sections of this lab write-up, below, have some
additional documentation and sample programs.  The exercises for
the lab are in the third section.  The <b>optional</b> fourth section is not
really part of the lab (since I decided to put off the material
that it covers until we do <span style="white-space:pre">x86-64</span> programming later in the semester).
You can read it, and try the two sample programs, to get a preview of
that material if you are interested.</p>

<p>All the files that you need for this lab can be found in the folder
<a href="lab3-files/" style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220/lab3-files</a>.  
They can also be downloaded using links on this web page.  (The files referenced 
in the optional material are only available through links.)</p>

<p><b>The assignment for the lab is to write several Larc programs, as
specified below.  The programs will be written as plain text files
named ex6.x, ex7.s, ex8.s, and ex9.s.  You should save those files
in a folder named lab3.  Turn in your work by copying the entire
lab3 folder to your homework submission folder in <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220/homework</span>.
As usual, work must be submitted by the start of next week's lab.

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>For our purposes, a "string" is just a sequences of 16-bit numbers,
representing Unicode characters, stored in consecutive locations in memory,
with a zero stored at the end to mark the end of the string.
The Larcsim simulator program, <a href="../larcsim.jar">larcsim.jar</a>,
includes some support for working with strings.  In particular, 
syscalls&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;3 let a program do input and output of strings.
Furthermore, the built-in assembler program allows you to place a string 
in memory when the program is loaded, by including a line in the
program that starts with a double-quote.  And you can control where
that string is placed in memory using a line starting with&nbsp;@.
For example,</p>

<pre class=code>@100
"Hello World!</pre>

<p class="np">puts the string "Hello World!" in memory, starting at
location 100, with a zero added to mark the end of the string.</p>

<p>As a simple example of doing string input/output, the sample Larc program 
<a href="lab3-files/string-io.s">string-io.s</a> reads strings from the user and echos
them.  Try running that program, and set the memory display to "Character."  Look in
memory starting at location 50 to see the string that is output at the start of
the program.  As the program runs, look at location 100 to see the string entered
by the user.<p>
</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Subroutines</h3>

<p>The last exercise for this lab will ask you to write and use a subroutine.
The file <a href="lab3-files/3N+1-with-subroutine.s" style="white-space:pre">3N+1-with-subroutine.s</a>
is an example of using a subroutine in a Larc machine language program.
</p>

<p>To implement subroutines on the machine level, there must be a
way to pass parameters to the subroutine, to jump to the address
where the subroutine is stored in memory, to jump back to the
point from which the subroutine was called when the subroutine ends, and possibly to return
some value to the caller.  There could be many ways to do all that,
but in any case, the subroutine and he caller must agree on the
details.  In a given environment &mdash; such as C programs compiled with the gcc compiler running
on an x86 processor &mdash; there will generally be some <b>calling
convention</b> that all callers and subroutines will know about and
follow.  For this lab, we have the freedom to make up any calling
convention that we want to use.</p>

<p>Remember that a subroutine can be called from different points
in a program.  When a subroutine ends, it has to transfer control back to
the particular place in the program from which the subroutine was called.
To do that, it needs to know the <b>return address</b>.  The return address
is something like a parameter, which needs to be passed to the subroutine
when it is called.  In the Larc model computer,
this is made possible by the <i>jalr</i> instruction.</p>

<p>A jalr instruction takes two registers as parameters.  When Larc
executes an instruction of the form <tt style="white-space:pre">jalr $A $B</tt>,
it copies the current value of the program counter, PC, into register&nbsp;A and
then copies the value from register&nbsp;B into the program counter.  The
value stored into register&nbsp;A is the address of the instruction that
follows the jalr instruction; this is the return address, where the the subroutine
needs to return when it ends.  The value from register&nbsp;B should be the
address of the start of the subroutine, and copying that value to the PC has the
effect of jumping to the start of the subroutine.</p>

<p>Let's say that we have a subroutine that is stored starting at memory
location 100, and that we want to save the return address in register&nbsp;14.
A&nbsp;call to the subroutine can be implemented with the two instructions</p>

<pre class=code>li $8 100  # (any register could be used here instead of $8)
jalr $14 $8</pre>

<p class=np>When the subroutine ends, it just has to jump to the address
stored in register&nbsp;14.  Since there is no need to save a return address
in this case, the jump can be implemented with</p>

<pre class=code>jalr $0 $14</pre>

<p class=np>(Remember that the value of register 0 is always equal to zero, so 
this instruction does not save the current PC.)</p>

<p>Of course, there is also the question of parameters and return values.
A simple calling convention might be for the caller to store any paramters in registers
1, 2, 3,&nbsp;&#8230; before calling the subroutine, and for the subroutine to
store the return value in register&nbsp;1 before returning.  For strings, arrays,
and other data structures, the address of the start of the data structure in 
memory can be passed.  (You should recognize this pattern from working with
syscalls.  A syscall is just a special kind of subroutine call, which calls
a subroutine in the operating system.)</p>

<p>The sample program <a href="lab3-files/3N+1-with-subroutine.s" style="white-space:pre">3N+1-with-subroutine.s</a>
computes and prints a 3N+1 sequence, using a subroutine to compute the next term in the
sequence.  The subroutine has one parameter, representing the current value of N, and
a return value, representing the next value of&nbsp;N.  Here is the well-documented
subroutine code:</p>

<pre class=code>#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A subroutine to compute the next term in a 3N+1 sequence.  The subroutine
# is at location 256.  When it is called, the current value of N must be
# in register 1.  The subroutine should be called with jalr, saving the
# return address in register 14.  When it returns, the next value of N is 
# in register 1.   Note that this subroutine also uses registers 10, 11, 12, 
# and 13.  Values in in those registers (as well as register 14) before the 
# subroutine is called are not preserved.

@256

li $11 1        # Store the constants used in the calculation
li $12 3
li $13 15

add $10 $0 $1   # Copy N into register 10

sll $10 $10 $13 # Set register 10 to the low-order bit in N.
srl $10 $10 $13 #     so register 10 will be non-zero when N is odd.

bnez $10 2      # If N is odd, jump to the "odd" case.

srl $1 $1 $11   # N is even; divide N by 2.
jalr $0 $14     # Return from subroutine.

mul $1 $1 $12   # N is odd; multiply N by 3, then add 1
add $1 $1 $11
jalr $0 $14     # Return from subroutine.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p class=np>In the program, N is in stored in register 4.  Calling the subroutine looks like this:</p>

<pre class=code>add $1 $0 $4    # Copy the parameter, N, to register 1.
lui $2 1        # Address of start of subroutine, 256, in register 2.
jalr $14 $2     # Call subroutine.

add $4 $0 $1    # Copy return value, the new value of N, to register 4.
</pre>

<h3>Assignments</h3>


<p style="text-indent:0"><b style="font-size:110%; color: #0000AA">Exercise 6:</b>
The file <a href="lab3-files/ex6.s">ex6.s</a> is a copy of the second sample
program from the <a href="../lab2/index.html">previous&nbsp;lab</a>,
which reads two integers from the user and prints their sum and their
product.  You should edit that file so that it prompts the user
for each input and labels the output.  A run of the program might
produce this:</p>

<pre class=code>
Your first number: 5
Your second number: 12
The sum is 17
The product is 60</pre>
           
<p class=np>Note that after outputting the sum, you will need to output
an end-of-line (that is, a string containing only the character&nbsp;\n).</p>



<hr align=center width="33%">

<p style="text-indent:0"><b style="font-size:110%; color: #0000AA">Exercise 7:</b>
For this exercise, create a new file named ex7.s.
This is a fairly easy exercise in storing numbers in memory.
You should write a program that reads a sequence of integers from the user
and stores that list of numbers in memory, starting at some specific memory
location.  Use a loop to read the numbers.  End the program when the user's number is zero.
In a more realistic program, you would want to do something with the 
list of numbers, but for this exercise, your only assignment is to store
them in memory.</p>

<p>You will need to use a register to hold 
the address of the memory location where the input number is stored.  Use any
initial address that you like (as long as you don't overwrite the program!).
After storing each number, increment the address.</p>

<p>Note that the sample program <a href="lab3-files/string-io.s">string-io.s</a>
reads items in a loop that ends when the user enters a certain input.  The general
flow of that program is similar to what you need to do for this exercise.</p>


<hr align=center width="33%">

<p style="text-indent:0"><b style="font-size:110%; color: #0000AA">Exercise 8:</b>
For this exercise, create a new file named ex8.s.
The program should read a string from the user, then print the length
of the string, and then print the reverse of the string.  (The reverse of a string
means the characters of the string in reverse order from the end of the string
back to the start.)  Put a very large maxlength in Register 3, to avoid having
the program discard some of the user's input.
You should prompt the user for the input, but you do not
have to label the outputs.  A typical run of the program might produce this
in the input/output area of the Larcsim window:</p>

<pre class=code>Enter a string, and I will print the length and the reverse.
Hello World!
12
!dlroW olleH</pre>

<p>After the syscall that inputs the string, Register 3 will contain the length of
the string, plus&nbsp;1. The 1 accounts for the zero stored in memory at the end
of the string. (<b>Note: There is an error in the documentation</b>, which says that
the value in Register&nbsp;3 does not include the zero at the end.)</p>

<p>To print the reverse of the string, Store the address of the <b>end</b> of the
string in a register.  (You know the starting address, and you know the length,
so you can compute the ending address.)  Then use a loop to print individual
characters from the string in reverse order.  Subtract one from the address
each time through the loop, to get the memory address of the next character
to be printed.</p>

<p>An easy way to know when to exit the loop is to also subtract one from the string
length each time the loop.  When that value becomes zero, you know that you have
output all of the characters.</p>


<p>Note that to output a single character, you might think that you need to copy that
character somewhere.  But you can avoid that.  You want to output a string of length&nbsp;1.
You can use a print-string syscall with the maximum string length (register&nbsp;3) set
equal to&nbsp;1.  Since the maximum length is one, the syscall will only print one
character, and you do not need a zero in memory to mark the end of the string.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p style="text-indent:0"><b style="font-size:110%; color: #0000AA">Exercise 9:</b>
For this exercise, start with a copy of the file <a href="lab3-files/ex9.s">ex9.s</a>.
You will write a subroutine to find the sum of a list of
numbers stored in memory.  And you will write a program that uses that subroutine to find the sum
of two specific lists.  The parameters to the subroutine should be the address
of the start of the list in memory and the number of integers in the list.
The return value from the subroutine should be the sum of the list.
Don't forget to document the subroutine fully!</p>

<p>The file ex9.s already includes
two lists of numbers, a list of five integers starting at memory location 256, 
and a list of 25 integers starting at memory location 512.  Start with
a copy of that file, and add your code for the program and subroutine.
The program should
find and print the sum of each list.  The output when the program is run should be
exactly as follows:</p>

<pre class=code>Sum of the first list: 17
Sum of the second list: 3253</pre>

<h3>Using a Stack</h3>

<p><b>This section is not part of the lab.</b>  It is just some extra information
and examples that you can read later, if you are interested.  This material is
fairly complicated, and it will take us some time to cover it when we get to it in
class, so don't worry about skipping it for now.  We will return 
to this topic later in the term, using a different assembly language.
The examples are
<a href="factorial.s">factorial.s</a> and <a href="fibonacci.s">fibonacci.s</a>,
which use recursive subroutines.</p>

<p>A more realistic implementation of subroutines has to take several things
into account.  First, a subroutine can call another subroutine, which can call
another, and so on.  In general, then, there is not just one return address to keep 
track of &mdash; there could be some arbitrary number.  So it's not enough to
use a single register for storing return addresses.</p>

<p>Second, it is possible that we might want to pass more parameter data to 
a subroutine than will fit in available registers.</p>

<p>And third, registers are a scarce resource, and a subroutine that uses
a register for scratch work or to store a local variable might be replacing values that 
some other routine has saved in that register for later use.  In general, there is a convention
that certain registers are always available for scratch work, while other
registers are "saved registers".  If a subroutine wants to use a saved register,
it must first save the value in that register, and it must restore that value
before returning.</p>

<p>In order to solve all of these problems, some data will have to be stored
in main memory instead of in registers.  The solution is to reserve a part of
memory for use as a <b>stack</b>.  A stack is a data structure that can grow and
shrink.  The staring point, or <b>bottom</b>, of the stack is at some fixed point in
memory.  The stack grows upwards, in the direction of decreasing addresses.
The <b>top</b> of the stack changes as the stack grows and shrinks.  A specific
register, which is called the <b>stack pointer</b>, is dedicated to keeping track
of the address of the top of the stack.  For my examples, the stack pointer
is register&nbsp;15.</p>

<p>The memory occupied by the stack grows and shrinks as subroutines are called 
and return.  When a subroutine is called, the stack pointer is decreased to make
room on the top of the stack for the memory space that is needed by the subroutine;
that memory is called the <b>activation record</b> for that subroutine call.
The activation record can for example hold the return address, local variables, and
copies of values from saved registers.  When the subroutine returns, the
value of the stack pointer is increased to restore the value that it had before
the subroutine was called.  This effectively discards the activation record.</p>

<p>Exactly who is responsible for managing the activation record &mdash; creating it,
deleting it, and copying data to and from it &mdash; depends on the subroutine
calling convention that is being used.  In my examples, the calling convention is
that the subroutine is responsible for everything, but in other conventions,
the caller of the subroutine might also be involved.  Note that a simple subroutine
that does not call other subroutines might not even need an activation record.
My calling convention goes like this, for a subroutine that does use an activation record:</p>

<ol>
<li>The caller loads parameter values into registers (as specified by the subroutine documentation).</li>
<li>The caller uses <i>jalr</i> to jump to the subroutine, with return address saved in register&nbsp;14.</li>
<li>The subroutine subtracts R from register 15, where R is the size of the activation record needed by
the subroutine.</li>
<li>The subroutine copies the return address from register 14 into the activation record.</li>
<li>The subroutine runs, possibly using other space in the activation record for local variables, etc.</li>
<li>The subroutine stores the return value (if there is one) in register&nbsp;1.</li>
<li>The subroutine copies the return address from the activation record to register 14.</li>
<li>The subroutine adds R to register 15, restoring the value of the stack pointer and
deleting the activation record.</li>
<li>The subroutine jumps unconditionally to the return address in register&nbsp;14.</li>
</ol>

<p>The sample program <a href="factorial.s">factorial.s</a> computes factorial(6) using
a recursive factorial function.  Factorial(N) is equal to 1 if N is 0, and is
<span style="white-space:pre">N*factorial(N-1)</span> for N&gt;0.  When the
factorial subroutine is called with a non-zero parameter, N, it saves N and the return
address in an activation record.  Note that N has to be saved because N will have a
different value in the recursive call to the subroutine, and the original value of N
will be needed after that subroutine call returns.</p>

<p>The sample program <a href="fibonacci.s">fibonacci.s</a> computes 
fibonacci(5) using a recursive subroutine.  Fibonacci(N) is defined to be 1
if N is 0 or 1, and is <span style="white-space:pre">fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2)</span>
for N&gt;1.  The fibonacci subroutine uses an activation record of size 3 to hold
the return address, the value of <span style="white-space:pre">N-1</span>,
and the value of <span style="white-space:pre">fibonacci(N-1)</span>.
It needs to save <span style="white-space:pre">N-1</span> while computing the
value of <span style="white-space:pre">fibonacci(N-1)</span>, and it needs 
to save <span style="white-space:pre">fibonacci(N-1)</span> while computing
the value of <span style="white-space:pre">fibonacci(N-2)</span>.</p>

<p>These examples demonstrate how and why to use a stack of activation records.
(However, they are not really good examples of recursion, since there are
more efficient, non-recursive methods for computing factorial(N) and fibonacci(N).
In fact, the recursive version of fibonacci(N) is really ridiculously inefficient.)</p>

<hr align=center width="33%"</hr>

<p>One note about Larc machine language and the stack.  The memory instructions,
lw and sw, have an optional third parameter.  That parameter is a four-bit signed integer,
representing a number in the range &minus;8 to&nbsp;7.  It represents an offset
that is added to the memory address specified in the instruction.  For example,</p>

<pre class=code>lw $1 $15 3</pre>

<p class=np>loads a value from the memory location whose address is given by
the number in register&nbsp;15 <b>plus&nbsp;3</b>.  This can be very useful for
accessing specific values that are stored in an activation record on the top
of the stack.  The stack pointer, $15, is the address of the first item in
the activation record.  That item can be read into register&nbsp;1 using 
<tt style="white-space:pre">lw $1 $15</tt> or <tt style="white-space:pre">lw $1 $15 0</tt>.
The second item can be loaded using <tt style="white-space:pre">lw $1 $15 1</tt>, the
third with <tt style="white-space:pre">lw $1 $15 2</tt>, and so on.  Note that without
the extra offset, you would have to modify the value in $15 to access items in the
activation record.  As an example, the sample program
<a href="factorial.s">factorial.s</a> creates an activation record and stores
values in it as follows:</p>

<pre class=code># Add an activation record containing N and return address to the stack.

li $2 2           # size of the activation record
sub $15 $15 $2    # makes space on the stack for the activation record
sw $1 $15 0       # store N at offset 0 from the top of the stack
sw $14 $15 1      # store return address at offset 1</pre>
