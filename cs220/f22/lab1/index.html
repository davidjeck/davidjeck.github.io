<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
Lab 1: Numbers and Bits</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>Welcome to the first lab for CPSC 220.  In this lab, you will
implement conversion between values of type int and their
string representations in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal form.
You will also convert an int value into the float value that is 
represented by exactly the same bits.  You will be working in Java.
Of course, Java can do all of these conversions itself, but for this
lab, you will have to program them yourself using only basic
arithmetic and bitwise operations.</p>

<p>You will start with an incomplete program, <a href="Bits.java">Bits.java</a>.
This program is meant to let the user enter a 32-bit integer in any of the following
forms: an ordinary base-10 integer, a binary number starting with "0b",
a hexadecimal number starting with "0x", or a floating point number with a
decimal point or exponent.  It will print out the value in all four formats.
The program already exists in outline and can be run.</p>

<p><b>The assignment is to complete the program Bits.java,
as discussed below.  You should turn in your completed program by the start
of next week's lab.</b></p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Turning in Your Work</h3>

<p>You have an account on the Math/CS Department's Linux computers.  I will 
make sure that you have the username and password that you need to use the account.
Note that you are <b>not</b> required to work on the lab in Linux,
but you are required to turn your lab work in to your Linux account.
You will submit your work by copying it into a homework folder in that account.
The name of the folder is <i style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220/homework/<b>LastName</b></i>,
where "LastName" should be replaced by your actual last name.
</p>

<p>For this lab, you will submit one file, named <i>Bits.java</i>.  One way to do
that from any computer that has a network connection is to use the <i>scp</i>
command in a Terminal.  Change into the directory that contains <i>Bits.java</i>
and give a command of the form</p>

<pre class=code>scp  Bits.java  <b>zz9999</b>@math.hws.edu:/classes/cs220/homework/<b>LastName</b>
</pre>

<p class=np>where you have to replace <b>zz9999</b> with your username and
replace <b>LastName</b> with your actual last named.  If you are working on one
of our Linux computers, you can use</p>

<pre class=code>cp  Bits.java  /classes/cs220/homework/<b>LastName</b>
</pre>

<p class=np>(Note that it's also possible to use an SFTP program such as 
<a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FireZilla&nbsp;Client</a>
for transferring files between your computer and your Linux account.  And if you
are working on a Linux computer in the lab, you can use the GUI to copy Bits.java
into your homework directory.)</p>

<p>If you have not managed to submit your file by the start of next week's lab,
you can get help to submit it during lab.  You should also be able to get help
from Teaching Fellows; their hours are Sunday through Thursday, 7:00 to 10:00 PM,
starting Sunday, August 28.</p>

<h3>About the Conversions</h3>

<p><a href="Bits.java">Bits.java</a> contains seven subroutines for converting between
different number representations.  One of them is already complete.  Your only job
for this lab is to <b>complete the other six conversion functions</b>.  You must do
the conversions without using any of Java's built-in subroutines.  Furthermore,
your subroutines should never crash the program; they should <b>detect any errors in
the input</b> and throw an <i>IllegalArgumentException</i> for any error that is found.</p>

<p>The function <i>floatStringToInt</i>() is already complete.  It uses Java's
built-in <i>Float.parseFloat()</i> to convert an input string to the floating point 
value that it represents.  The result is a 32-bit binary representation of the <i>float</i>
value.  The subroutine has to return the <i>int</i> value that is represented by 
the same 32 bits.  The conversion is done using <i>Float.floatToRawIntBits</i>().
This function does not actually do anything with its input; it just returns the
unmodified 32 bits, but treated as an <i>int</i> instead of as a <i>float</i>.
I don't know of any other way to do this type conversion in Java.</p>

<p>The reverse conversion from <i>int</i> to <i>float</i> could be done by
<i>Float.intBitsToFloat</i>().  However, for this lab you are asked to implement
the same conversion in the function <i>myIntBitsToFloat</i>().  The algorithm is
given in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Float.html#intBitsToFloat(int)">documentation</a>
for <i>Float.intBitsToFloat</i>().  You should implement that algorithms exactly.
One note on the implementation:  When Java computes 
<i style="white-space:pre">s*m*Math.pow(2.0,e-150)</i>, the result is of type
<i>double</i>, and you will have to type-cast it to type <i>float</i>.</p>

<p>For the remaining String conversion functions, <i>hexStringToFloat</i>(),
<i>binaryStringToFloat</i>(), and <i>decimalStringToFloat</i>(), you should
apply the basic algorithm for converting a base-N string to an integer:</p>

<pre>            num = 0
            for each character, ch, in the string
               num = N*num + (base-N equivalent of the character ch)
</pre>

<p class=np>There are a few issues that you will have to deal with:
You will want to throw <i>IllegalArgumentException</i> for illegal
characters and values that are too big to be represented in 32-bits.
To make it possible to check for out-of-range values, you are strongly encouraged
to <b>use type <i>long</i> in your calculations</b>, and type-cast to type <i>int</i>
at the end.  
Binary and hexadecimal strings are meant to be unsigned, allowing
values in the range 0 to <span style="white-space:pre">2<sup>32</sup>-1</span>.
For decimal numbers, you will need to account for the fact that
a decimal string is allowed to start with a plus or minus sign,
and you can allow values from &ndash;2<sup>31</sup> to
<span style="white-space:pre">2<sup>32</sup>-1</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to complete <i>intToBinaryString</i>() and
<i>intToHexString</i>().  You need to produce the base-2 and base-16 strings
that represent a 32-bit integer value,&nbsp;<i>n</i>.  To do that, you need to
look at the individual bits or groups of four bits in&nbsp;<i>n</i>.
For this lab, <b>you are required to do that using Java's bitwise operators</b>.
(I&nbsp;don't care whether you include leading zeros in your strings.  For
example, both 0x9fa3b and 0x0009fa3b are acceptable.)</p>

<h3>About the Bitwise Operators</h3>

<p>The algorithm for <i>myIntBitsToFloat</i>() uses Java's bitwise operators,
and you are also required to use them for <i>intToBinaryString</i>()
and <i>intToHexString</i>().  You could also, optionally, use them in
<i>hexStringToFloat</i>() and<i>binaryStringToFloat</i>().
Since you might be new to bitwise operators and hexadecimal numbers,
this section provides some documentation for them.</p>

<p>Java (like C and many other programming languages) has four
<b>bitwise logical operators</b> that operate on individual bits within
integers. An integer is represented internally using the binary number
system, that is, as a sequence of 0's and 1's.  A value of type <i>int</i>
in Java is, for example, a 32-bit integer.  The <i>byte</i>, <i>short</i>,
and <i>long</i> data types use, respectively, 8, 16, and 64 bits.
The bitwise logical operators <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>,
and <code>^</code> are binary operators that operate on a pair of integers, 
while <code>~</code> is a unary operator that operates on a single integer.
These are the bitwise <b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, <b>exclusive&nbsp;or</b> and <b>not</b>
operators.
When these operators are applied to multi-bit integers, they
apply to each bit position separately.
Their operations on individual bits are defined by this table:</p>

<p class=np>  For example,
<code style="white-space:pre">00101110 &amp; 10100011 = 00100010</code>, and
<code style="white-space:pre">~00101110 = 11010001</code>.</p>

<p>Java also has three <b>shift operators</b> that work on the level
of bits.  The shift operators shift all the bits in a number
a specified number of positions to the left or to the right. The operators
are <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, and
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, and they are defined for integers
<code>x</code> and <code>N</code> as:</p>

<table align=center bgcolor=white cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>
<tr>
   <td>x &lt;&lt; N</td>
   <td style="text-align:left">The <b>left shift</b> operator.<br>
       Shift the bits in x to the <b>left</b> by N bit positions,<br>
       losing bits from the left end of x, and filling<br>
       in vacated positions on the right with zeros
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>x &gt;&gt;&gt; N</td>
   <td style="text-align:left">The <b>logical right shift</b> operator.<br>
       Shift the bits in x to the <b>right</b> by N bit positions,<br>
       losing bits from the right end of x, and filling<br>
       in vacated positions on the left with zeros
   </d>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>x &gt;&gt; N</td>
   <td style="text-align:left">The <b>arithmetic right-shift</b> operator.<br>
       Shift the bits in x to the <b>right</b> by N bit positions,<br>
       losing bits from the right end of x, and filling<br>
       in vacated positions on the left with zeros or ones.<br>
       (Use zeros if x is positive, ones if x is negative.)
   </d>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The bit positions in a 32-bit integer are numbered
0, 1, 2, ..., 31, from right to left.  Note in particular that
<code style="white-space:pre">(1 &lt;&lt; N)</code>
is an integer that has a 1 in bit position <code>N</code>
and a 0 in every other position.  And
<code style="white-space:pre">(x &gt;&gt;&gt; N)</code>
is a number whose 0-th bit is equal to the <code>N</code>-th bit of <code>x</code>.
You can use this to set or test
the <code>N</code>-th bit in an integer&nbsp;<code>x</code>:</p>

<table align=center bgcolor=white cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>
<tr>
   <td>x = x | (1 &lt;&lt; N);</td>
   <td>Sets bit N of x to be 1.
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>x = x &amp; ~(1 &lt;&lt; N);</td>
   <td>Sets bit N of x to be 0.
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>x = x ^ (1 &lt;&lt; N);</td>
   <td>Flips the N-th bit of x.
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>y = (x &gt;&gt;&gt; N) &amp; 1;</td>
   <td>y is the N-th bit of x (0 or 1).
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>if ( (x &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; N)) != 0 )</td>
   <td>Tests if the N-th bit of x is 1.<br>(Parentheses around 1 &lt;&lt; N are <i>required</i>.)
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>if ( ((x &gt;&gt;&gt; N) &amp; 1 ) != 0 )</td>
   <td>An alternative way to test<br>if the N-th bit of x is 1.
   </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can also work with groups of bits.  For example,
the number 15 in binary is 00000000000000000000000000001111.
If you compute <code style="white-space:pre">y = x &amp; 15</code>,
then <code>y</code> has the same bits as <code>x</code> in
positions 0, 1, 2, and 3, while all the other bits of <code>y</code>
are&nbsp;0.  This is called <b>masking</b>; you have "masked out"
all the bits of <code>x</code> except for the first 4.  By 
combining this with a shift, you can get other groups of
four bits out of <code>x</code>.  For example,
<code style="white-space:pre">(x &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 15</code>
would get you bits 4, 5, 6, and 7 from&nbsp;<code>x</code>.</p>

<p>Working with groups of four bits becomes easier if you use
<b>hexadecimal numbers</b>.  Hexadecimal numbers use the
symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
Each symbol represents a group of 4 bits, as shown in this table:

    <tr>
      <td>E</td>
      <td>1110</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>1111</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="np">You can use hexadecimal numbers in Java by prefixing them
with <code>0x</code>.  For example, <code>0xF</code> is 15 (a number
with 1111 in the rightmost four bit positions), and
<code>0xFFFF0000</code> is the number with 0's in bit positions 0 through 15
and 1's in positions 16 through 31.</p>

<p>Note that this notation is not case-sensitive. The lowercase letters a, b, c, d, e, f
are considered to be equivalent to the uppercase A, B, C, D, E, F.</p>

<p>Both hexadecimal and binary numbers can be used in a Java program to represent
integers.  A hexadecimal literal must start with 0x or 0X &mdash; for example, 0xFACE1234.
A binary literal must start with 0b or 0B &mdash; for example, 0b10010101.
A 32-bit integer can be represented by a 32-bit binary literal or by an 8-digit
hexadecimal literal.</p>
