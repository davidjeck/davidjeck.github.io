<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
    About the Second Test</h2>
<hr noshade>

<p>The second test in CS 220 will be given in class on Wednesday, November 9.
Topics include: the memory hierarchy and caching; the design of 
Larc-in-Logisim and relevant material on logic circuits; the <span style="white-space:pre">x86-64</span> architecture; 
<span style="white-space:pre">x86-64</span> assembly language programming;
the Linux C calling convention; and basic functions from the Linux standard
library. This includes material from labs&nbsp;7 through&nbsp;11.  For textbook
readings, you can consult the weekly entries on the course web page for
the sixth through eleventh weeks.  A&nbsp;detailed list of topics is given below.</p>

<p>For the memory hierarchy, there will be only general questions; you do not
need to understand how caching is implemented.  For Larc-in-Logisim, you should
be familiar with the overall design, and you should remember enough about logic
circuits to do the sorts of things that were used in the implementation.  You will
not need to memorize the commands for assembling and linking assembly language
programs, and you will not need to memorize the details of register use or
the Linux C calling convention beyond knowing which registers to use for
the first four function arguments; if more information is needed, it will be
provided to you.  There will be no questions about: debugging or ddd; C&nbsp;programming or pointers
in C; specific syscalls; or assembly language instructions that are not listed below.</p>

<p>The format of the test will be as usual.  There will be four pages.
The types of questions might include: definitions, short-answer and longer
essay-type questions, basic coding questions using 
<span style="white-space:pre">x86-64</span> assembly language, reading and explaining 
assembly language instructions, implementing control structures in assembly language,
writing and using functions in assembly langauge, and designing basic circuits similar
to ones used in Larc-in-Logisim.</p>

<p><b>Here are some terms and ideas that you should be familiar with:</b></p>

<pre style="margin-left: 1cm">
Larc-in-Logisim
   how a complicated logic circuit can store and execute computer programs
   the overall structure (like how the register file connects to the ALU)
   the role of the clock
   the role of the PC
   the structure of the register file
   how different sources of input can be selected for the PC and register
   how the opcode is used to control the computation
   how to build a logic circuit to test the opcode

the memory hierarchy
   registers, cache memory, RAM, hard disks and SSDs
   how levels of the memory hierarchy compare in terms of speed, cost, and size
   caches and why they are used

the x86-64 architecture (for integers only)
   16 general purpose registers
   how registers are used for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit values
   flag register, including the carry flag, C, and other flags
   a memory location holds one byte; an address is 64 bits
   little-endian representation of integers
   
x86-64 assembly language
   assembling an assembly language (.asm) file with yasm to get an object (.o) file
   linking object files with ld to get an executable program
   sections of a program:  .data, .text
   data sizes: byte, word, dword, qword
   declaring initialized variables in the .data section: db, dw, dd, and dq
   declaring strings and arrays in the .data section
   using registers in assembly langauge
   64-bit registers rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, r8 through 15
   32-bit registers eax, epx, ecx, edx, r8d through r15d
   accessing memory, with brackets []
   using a data size in an assembly instruction, such as  inc dword [A]
   labels
   global and extern
   the _start label for marking the entry point of a program
   basic assembly language commands (see list below)
   comparing values and jumping
   the stack and the rsp register; push and pop
   calling and returning from functions
   syscall and why it exists (but nothing about any specific syscall)

the difference between pointers (addresses) and values (in memory)
translating Java-style control structures into assembly language
accessing array elements with notations like [A + r12*8]
writing and using functions in assembly language
how the stack is used for functions

calling convention
the Linux C calling convention
in the C calling convention, arguments are passed in rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx
callee-saved and caller-saved registers in the C calling convention
writing functions that can be called from C
using functions from the C standard library
using printf for output of integers and strings
understanding C function prototypes well enough to call a function

x86-64 assembly instructions that you should know for the test:
   add &lt;dest>, &lt;src>      and &lt;dest>, &lt;src>     jmp &lt;label>
   sub &lt;dest>, &lt;src>      or &lt;dest>, &lt;src>      je &lt;label>
   inc &lt;dest>             not &lt;dest>, &lt;src>     jne &lt;label>
   dec &lt;dest>                                   jg &lt;label>
   imul &lt;dest>, &lt;src>     call &lt;label>          jge &lt;label>
   div &lt;dest>, &lt;src>      ret                   jl &lt;label>
   mov &lt;dest>, &lt;src>      push &lt;src>            jle &lt;label>   
                          pop &lt;dest>            cmp &lt;op1> &lt;op2>

<b>Here are a few sample questions.</b>  This is not meant to be a comprehensive 
survey of all the types of questions or all of the topics that you might see on the test.</p>

<p><b style="font-size:120%">1.</b>
What memory is allocated by the following .data section in an x86-64 assembly language program?
