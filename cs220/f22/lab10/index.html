<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
Lab 10: Control Structures in x86-64 Assembly</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>In this lab, you will work on several exercises that ask you to implement
control structures in x86-64 assembly language, using jump instructions.
All operations will be done on unsigned qwords or on strings.  You will really
be doing the work of a compiler&mdash;translating a higher level description
of an algorithm into low-level assembly code.</p>

<p><b>You have the option of working on this lab with a partner of your choice.</b>
Two people working together should submit just <b>one</b> copy of their work, to
the homework folder for either partner.  Both names <b>must</b> be in a comment
at the top of the program.</p>

<p><b>Work from this lab is due at the start of next week's lab as usual.  You 
will turn in one assembly language program named lab10.asm. Copy your file
to your folder in <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220/homework</span></b></p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h3>Procedures</h3>

<p>Start with a copy of the file <a href="lab10.asm">lab10.asm</a>, which you can get
from this page or from <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220</span>.  That file 
contains an outline for all the exercises that you will work on for this lab.  All of your
work for the lab will be in <i>lab10.asm</i>.  You should submit a copy of the completed
file to your homework folder.</p>

<p>You will also need a copy of <i>basicprint.o</i>.  You should already have a copy 
in your work from last week's lab.  Or you can get a copy of <a href="basicprint.asm">basicprint.asm</a>
from this page or from <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220</span>, and
assemble it to get <i>basicprint.o</i>.  The assembled file <i>lab10.o</i> has to be linked with
<i>basicprint.o</i> to produce an executable.  You should make no changes to basicprint.asm;
your program must work with the original version.</p>

<p>You will use the functions <i>printlong</i> and <i>printstring</i> from basicprint.asm to 
output numbers and strings.  Keep in mind that these functions use many registers internally.
When you call the function, you should expect the values in those
registers to change.  It should always be safe to use r12, r13, r14, r15, and rbx.  You can
do all of the exercises for the lab using just those five registers.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p>You are not required to use the <i>ddd</i> debugger for this lab, but you might want
to do so to help find errors in your code.  You might want to examine the contents of
memory while running your program under <i>ddd</i>.  You can do that with the <i>x</i>
command in the panel at the bottom of the <i>ddd</i> windows.  The <i>x</i> command
is discussed on page 64 of <a href="http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~ed/assembly64.pdf">Jorgensen</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <i>x</i> to print out strings and numbers that are pointed to by variables 
in the program.  The variable name must always be preceded by a&nbsp;&amp;; this is related
to syntax used in the C programming language.  To print out the value of a variable A as
a 64-bit decimal integer, use the command</p>

<pre class=code>     x/dg  &amp;A
</pre>

<p class=np>If A points to an array of 64-bit integers, you can print out the first 12 values 
in the array with</p>

<pre class=code>     x/12dg  &amp;A
</pre>

<p class=np>If A is a string, display it using</p>

<pre class=code>     x/s  &amp;A
</pre>


<hr align=center width="33%">

<p><b>Some extra info.</b> The file <a href="build.sh">/classes/cs220/build.sh</a> is a build script that
can create an executable from .asm and .o files.  For example,</p>

<pre class=code>    /classes/cs220/build.sh  lab10.asm  basicprint.o
</pre>

<p class=np>will assemble lab10.asm and link lab10.o with basicprint.o to produce
an executable named lab10.  Each input file can be either an .asm or a .o file.
Exactly one of the input files should define _start as a global label.  The name
of the executable is the name of the first input file with the .o or .asm extension
removed.  You can optionally copy <i>build.sh</i> into your working directory and run it
using ./build.sh.</p>

<p>It can be annoying to type the long commands that you need to assemble and link
assembly language programs.  In Linux, you can define "aliases", or abbreviations,
for commands.  The alias definitions can be added to a file named .bashrc in your
home directory.  Since the name of that file begins with a period, it is a hidden
file, but you can edit it using the following command in your home directory:</p>

<pre class=code>    xed  .bashrc
</pre>

<p class=np>For example, you might want to add the following alias definitions to .bashrc</p>

<pre class=code>
    alias y='yasm -felf64 -gdwarf2'
    alias b='/classes/cs220/build.sh'
</pre>

<p class=np>Changes don't take effect until you open a new Terminal window, since .bashrc
is only executed when you open a Terminal or log in remotely.  With these aliases, 
you could type "y&nbsp;lab10.asm" instead of 
<span style="white-space:pre">"yasm -felf64 -gdwarf2 lab10.asm"</span>
and <span style="white-space:pre">"b lab10.asm basicprint.o"</span> instead of
<span style="white-space:pre">"/classes/cs220/build.sh lab10.asm basicprint.o"</span></p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<p>The file lab10.asm contains a label for each exercise, named <i>Exercise1:</i>, <i>Exercise2:</i>,
<i>Exercise3:</i>, and so on.  You should add your solution for each exercise after the
corresponding label.  You might want to use local lables in the code that you
write.  A local label is a label whose name begins with a period. You can use
local labels with the same name in different exercises without conflict.  Remember that
local labels expire at the next regular label.</p>
 
<p><b>Please add some labels and blank lines</b> to the output from your program to
make it look nicer.  Sample output is shown below.
The full specification for what each exercise should do is given here:</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 1:</b> Simple loop.
   Write a loop that will print the integers from 1 to 10, all on one line, separated by
   spaces.  The output should look like this, with an end-of-line at the end:
</p>
<pre class=code>
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
</pre>
<p class=np>Note that lab10.asm already defines a string that contains a single space character
and a string that contains an end-of-line character.</p>


<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 2:</b> Count the E's.  There is already a variable named <i>advice</i>
that points to a string.  You should write some code to find and output the number of times the letter E
occurs in the string.  You should count both upper and lower case E's.  Pseudocode for the algorithm
is given by</p>

<pre class=code>
     count = 0     ; for counting the e's
     ptr = advice  ; pointer to next char from string
     while (char at address ptr is not zero) {
         if the char is 'e'
            count++
         else if the char is 'E'
            count++
         ptr++
     }
     output count
</pre>

<p class=np>When comparing a byte to 'e' or 'E', you actually need to compare the ASCII codes, which
represent the characters in memory.  But yasm has a nice feature that lets you to use a character
constant to represent a byte value.  For example, if register r12 holds the address of a character
in memory and you want to compare that character to 'E', you can simply say</p>

<pre class=code>     cmp byte [r12], 'E'
</pre>


<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 3:</b> Fizz-Buzz.  For this exercises, you should write code to
solve the well-known fizz-buzz coding problem:
output the numbers from 1 to 100, but if the number is divisible by 3 output <i>Fizz</i> instead, if the number is
divisible by 5 output <i>Buzz</i> instead, and if the number is divisible by both, output <i>Fizz&nbsp;Buzz</i>.  That is,
implement the following pseudocode:
</p>
<pre class=code>
     count = 1
     while count &lt;= 100 {
        if (count % 15)
            output "Fizz Buzz"
        else if (count % 3)
            output "Fizz"
        else if (count % 5)
            output "Buzz"
        else
            output count
        output an end-of-line
        count = count + 1
     }
</pre>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 4:</b> Array Max.  LIST is already defined in lab10.asm as a
label for an array of numbers.  Also, LISTlen is a variable giving the number of items in the array.
Write code to find and output the largest value in the array.  Your code should work for any array,
but you can assume that the number of items is at least one.

<p>(Note:  The definition of LIST uses a yasm feature I haven't mentioned:  If a line in the 
program ends with a backslash character ("\"), then the next line in the file is considered to be
a continuation of that line.  That is, an end-of-line after a&nbsp;"\" is essentially ignored.)</p>
</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 5:</b> Selection Sort.  Sort the array that LIST points to, using
the following Selection Sort algorithm, and then output the list.</p>
<pre class=code>
for ( top = LISTlen - 1; top &gt; 0; top-- ) {
    maxLoc = 0
    max = LIST[0]
    for ( i = 0; i &lt;= top; i++ ) {
       if ( LIST[i] &gt; max ) {
           maxLoc = i
           max = LIST[i]
       }
    }
    temp = LIST[top]   // (These two lines implement LIST[maxLoc] = LIST[top].)
    LIST[maxLoc] = temp
    LIST[top] = max
}
for ( i = 0; i < LISTlen; i++ ) {
    output LIST[i]
}
</pre>

<p class=np>Remember that you can use <tt>[LIST+r15*8]</tt> to implement a reference to an array
element that in Java would be <tt>LIST[r15]</tt>.</p>
