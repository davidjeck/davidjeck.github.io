<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
Lab 12: Floats and Files</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>This is a relatively short lab.  It will only be worth ten points instead of the
usual fifteen.  You will use some the x86-64 instructions for
working with floating point numbers, and you will work with files using functions
from the standard C library.  The program that you write will need to be linked
to the C library.  You can use the same <a href="build.sh">build&nbsp;script</a> that
you used for last week's <a href="../lab11/index.html">lab</a>, with the -c option. </p>


<p><b>This lab is an individual assignment. You cannot work with a partner.</b></p>

<p>This lab is due next Thursday, as usual.  Please name the file <b>lab12.asm</b> and submit
it to your homework folder
</p>

<p>(Note that because of the test and because it was
a longer lab than usual, the due date for Lab&nbsp;11 has been changed
to Monday, November 14, at 3:00&nbsp;PM.)</p>

<h3>Processing a Data File</h3>

<p>You will write this week's program from scratch.  Create a new text file named <i>lab12.asm</i>
for your program.</p>

<p>The program will do some simple numerical processing of floating point values.  The data
that you process will come from an input file, and the results will be written to an output file.
This is just an exercise in using floating point and files; neither the data nor the processing
is meaningful or interesting.</p>

<p>The input file for the program is <a href="data12.txt">data12.txt</a>.  You can get a copy
from the folder <span style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220</span>, or you can download it from
the above link.  The name of the output file is up to you; you do <b>not</b> need to turn in the
output file.  You do <b>not</b> need to ask the user to input the file names; you can hard
code them into your program.
Remember that when you open an existing file for output, the current contents of
the file will be erased.  For this lab, you are <b>not</b> required to check whether the output
file exists before opening it.</p>

<p>The sample programs <a href="../integral.asm">integral.asm</a> and 
<a href="../copyfile.asm">copyfile.asm</a> work with floating point numbers and files.
You might find some of the code from copyfile.asm, in particular, to be useful.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p class=np><b>The assignment:</b></p>

<p>The format of the input file, data12.txt, is as follows:  Each line of text contains
a name, an integer, and several floating point numbers.  The integer is the number of
floating point values on the same line. The number of items is always greater
than zero.  Items on the line are separated by spaces.  The
name does not contain spaces, so it can be read using the format specification&nbsp;%s.</p>

<p>You will write one line to the output file for each line of input.  The output line
contains two items: a copy of the name from the input line and the average of the
floating point values from the input line.  (To find the average, add up the
values and divide by the count.)</p>

<p>The end of the file is not marked in any way.  You can recognize the end of file
when <i>fscanf</i> cannot read the data from the start of a line, that is, when
the return value from <i>fscanf</i> is less than the number of items that you
were trying to read.</p>

<p>You should check the return value from <i>fopen</i> when opening the files.  If a file
can't be opened, you should print an error message and exit.  As noted above the name of 
the output file is up to you.  The data in data12.txt has the specified format, so if your
program is correct, the only error that you will encounter while processing it is the
read error from <i>fscanf</i> at the end the file.  However, you might want to check for
input errors anyway because they can reveal errors in your program.  (When I wrote my 
own program, a bug caused it to output an infinite number of lines; it wrote several
megabytes before I was able to stop it with Control-C.)</p>

<p class=np><b>Discussion and hints:</b></p>

<p>I had a strange bug when writing my solution to this lab.  I spent a lot of time on
it and learned something new:  <b>When calling a varargs function such as <i>fprintf</i>,
the rax register is supposed to contain the number of xmm registers that are used
for passing arguments to the function.</b>  I am still not sure why this is necessary,
but in my program, when rax was zero, <i>printf</i> did not print out correct floating
point values from xmm registers.  (Apparently, rax really just has to be non-zero when
passing values in xmm registers.)</p>

<p>When using <i>fscanf</i>, you need to pass addresses to the function where you want
the input values to be stored.  This pretty much forces you to use variables for the
data.  My solution defines the variables that I needed in the following .bss section:</p>

<pre class=code>
section .bss
     
    name resb 100  ; The name that is the first item on an input line.
    count resq 1   ; The integer that is the second item on an input line.
    data resq 1    ; One of the floating point data items from an input line.
    sum resq 1     ; The sum of the floating point data items from an input line.
</pre>

<p class=np>Allowing 100 bytes for the name is more than enough.  You can assume that
all the names in the file are short.</p>

<p>I learned the hard way that none of the xmm registers are safe when calling functions.
This is another reason to use variables rather than registers for the floating point
values in particular: The values of the variables are safe and will not be changed by
calling a function.</p>

<p>You can use the %s format for reading and for writing the name.  You can use
either %d or %ld for integers and either %g or %lg for floating point values.
The %ld and %lg are for 64-bit values.  There are other formats for floating
point values, but the "g" format generally works well.</p>
