<h2>CPSC 220, Fall 2022<br>
Lab 5: Memory Circuits in Logisim</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>For this lab, you will work with the Logisim
program that you used in the <a href="../lab5/index.html">previous&nbsp;lab</a>.
Last week, you built combinational circuits.
This week, you will build memory circuits.
A memory circuit is a kind of sequential circuit, since its output can
depend on the sequence of past inputs instead of just on the current input.</p>

<p>You will build five circuits:  a D-latch, a D-flip-flop,
a basic 8-bit register, a four-location RAM, and an 8-bit register that can take its
input from several different sources.  Logisim already includes similar
pre-defined circuits, but the point of the lab is to build the circuits
of yourself, starting from basic logic gates.</p>

<p><b>The lab is due next Thursday as usual.  (But because of the test next Wednesday,
requests for short extensions will likely be granted.)
You should create a single file named <i>lab5.circ</i>
containing the five circuits that you create for this lab.
To submit your work, copy your <i>lab5.circ</i>
file into your homework folder in <i style="white-space:pre">/classes/cs220/homework</i>.</b></p>

<div class="section">

<h3>Circuit #1:  D-Latch</h3>

<p>We covered D-latches and D-flip-flops in class.  You will start by making a
D-latch circuit for this exercise.  Start up Logisim and use the "Add&nbsp;Circuit" command from the
"Project" menu to create a new circuit named "<span style="white-space:pre">D-Latch</span>".</p>

<p><b><span style="color:#AA0000">Warning:</span> The memory circuits that you build for this lab might show
errors on some of the wires until their Load/Clock inputs are turned on and off to store a value in
the circuit.  This is normal.</b></p>

<p>Recall that a D-latch 
has two inputs, <i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i> and <i>Load</i>.  It
has one output, <i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i>.  The operation is
this:  As long as <i>Load</i> wire is ON, the value of <i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i>
is that same as <i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i>.  When the <i>Load</i> input
is OFF, <i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i> cannot change.  Basically,
the circuit is a 1-bit memory that stores the value that is on the data-in wire at the time that the clock input
is turned off.  As a memory, its operating rule is: Place the value that you want to save on
<i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i>, then turn <i>Load</i> on and off; the stored value is
then protected as long as <i>Load</i> is off.</p>

<p>A D-Latch can be built from an S-R (or "Set/Reset") latch plus some added circuitry.
(In an <span style="white-space:pre">S-R</span> latch, turning the Set input
on and off  stores a 1, and turning Reset on and off stores a zero.)
Start your circuit with an <span style="white-space:pre">S-R</span> latch, 
using either of the two designs from class.
(One design uses two NOR gates.  The other uses an OR gate, an AND gate, and
a NOT gate.) Recall that the two versions look like this; use the one you like:


<p align=center class=np><img src="S-R.png" width="530" height="123"></p>

<p class=np>Add the <i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i> and <i>Load</i> inputs
and the <i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i> output.  (<b>Please add labels to your
inputs and outputs.</b>)  
You can then add the extra circuitry that you need for a
<span style="white-space:pre">D-Latch</span>:  Two AND gates and a NOT gate.  The
extra circuitry is there to make sure that <i>Set</i> is only turned
on when both <i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i> and <i>Load</i> are on.
And <i>Reset</i> should be on only when <i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i>
is off and <i>Load</i> is on.  Be sure to test your circuit to make
sure that it works correctly.</p>

</div>




<div class="section">

<h3>Circuit #2: D-Flip-Flop</h3>

<p>Use "Add Circuit" to create a second new circuit, named "<span style="white-space:pre">D-flip-flop</span>".
Like a  <span style="white-space:pre">D-Latch</span>, a
<span style="white-space:pre">D-flip-flop</span> has a <i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i>
and a <i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i>, but the <i>Load</i> input
is renamed to be a <i>Clock</i> input, and 
the output can only change on the falling edge of the
clock cycle, that is, at the moment that the clock is turned off.
(The Clock input is meant ultimately to be connected to an actual clock component,
but for now, it will just be a regular input that you will turn on and off by hand.)
</p>

<p>The circuit is very simple to build, as we saw in class.
(Add two copies of your <i>D-latch</i> circuit.  The first latch's output connects
to the second latch's input.  The <span style="white-space:pre">flip-flop's</span>
 <i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i>
connects to the Data-in of the first latch, while the <span style="white-space:pre">flip-flop's</span>
<i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i> connects to the Data-out
of the second latch.  The <span style="white-space:pre">flip-flop's</span>
 <i>Clock</i> input connects to the latches' <i>load</i> inputs, directly to one
of the two latches, and through a NOT gate to the other latch.  Where you put
the NOT gate determines whether the output changes on the rising clock edge
or the falling clock edge. For this lab, you want it to change on the falling clock edge.
Again, test your circuit to make sure that it works!)</p>

<h3>Circuit #3: Basic 8-bit Register</h3>

<p>Next, add a new circuit to your project named <i>Register</i>, and construct
an <span style="white-space:pre">8-bit</span> register.  The register should have an 8-bit
<i style="white-space:pre">Data-in</i>
input and an 8-bit <i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i> output.  It has
a <b style="white-space:pre">one-bit</b> <i>Clock</i> input that connects to
all eight registers.  It can be built using 8 <span style="white-space:pre">D-flip-flops</span> 
and a couple of Splitters.</p>



</div>



<div class="section">

<h3>Circuit #4: Four Location RAM</h3>

<p>For the fourth circuit, add another circuit to the project named <i>RAM</i>.  You should
build a four-location addressable memory, with each location holding an 8-bit number.  We looked 
at the basic structure for the circuit in class.</p>

<p>The RAM will contain four copies of your 8-bit Register.  Each register is a location in
the RAM and has an address: 00, 01, 10, or 11.</p>

<p>There will be: a 2-bit <i>address</i> input that specifies a location;
an 8-bit <i style="white-space:pre">data-in</i> input, used to specify a value to be stored
in the selected location; an 8-bit <i style="white-space:pre">data-out</i> output, which shows 
the value currently stored in the selected location; and a 1-bit <i>clock</i> input.</p>

<p>To store a value, that value has to be on the <i style="white-space:pre">data-in</i> input,
and the clock input must turned on and off.  The value is stored in the location specified by
the <i>address</i>.</p>

<p>(I should note that actual RAMs, like the memory in your computer, are built in a 
more efficient way.)</p>

<div class="section">

<h3>Circuit #5: Multi-input Register</h3>

<p>A register in a CPU can often take its input from several different
sources, depending on the instruction that is being executed.  For that
to be possible, of course, there must be "select" control wires that specify
which of the inputs is actually stored into the register.  The source
of the input can be selected using a multiplexer.   All the possible 
inputs are inputs to the multiplexer, and the output of the multiplexer is
the selected input for the register. 
(An alternative to using a multiplexer would be to design your own
control circuitry, which might be more efficient in this case; however,
I suggest using a standard Logisim multiplexer component.)</p>

<p>You can build your multi-input register as the "main" circuit of
the file that you are creating.  (Double-click "main" to open that
circuit for editing.)</p>

<p>Add a copy of your 8-bit register to the circuit, to use as a basis for
the new circuit.  The register will have four possible sources of input.
To control the input to the register, you can use a standard 
Logisim multiplexer component, with its "Data Bits" set to 8 and its 
"Select Bits" set to&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>The circuit will have an eight bit <i>Data-in</i> input, an eight bit 
<i style="white-space:pre">Data-out</i> output showing the current value
stored in the register, a two bit <i style="white-space:pre">Select</i>
input to select the source of input to the register, and a
<i>Clock</i> input connected to the Clock input of the register.</p>

<p>When the Clock input is turned on and off, a new value is stored in the
register on the falling edge of the clock.  There are four possible
sources for the new value.  Which value is stored depends on the value 
of the Select input, which can be 00, 01, 10, or 11.  Here is how the
value stored in the register should correspond to the Select value:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>00</b> &mdash; The new value comes from the <i>Data-in</i> input.</li>
<li><b>01</b> &mdash; The new value is zero; the value can come from a Logisim Constant component set equal to zero.</li>
<li><b>10</b> &mdash; The new value is the current value plus 1; the value can be computed using
a Logisim Adder component and a Constant component with its value set equal to&nbsp;one.</li>
<li><b>11</b> &mdash; The new value is the current value shifted right one bit position, with a zero to 
fill in the vacated spot on the left; the value can be computed using a couple of Splitters and a Constant
set equal to zero.</li>
</ul>

<p class=np>As always, be sure to test your circuit!</p>
