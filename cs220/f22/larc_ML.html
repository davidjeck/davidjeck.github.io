<h2>Larc Computer and Machine Language</h2>

<hr>

<p>"Larc," or "little architecture," is a very simple model computer and an ISA 
(Instruction Set Architecture) for that computer.  
It was developed about a dozen years ago by Marc Corliss for
use in CS&nbsp;220 when he was a professor at Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
We will use it in CS&nbsp;220 this semester as a first example of an ISA, and
later in the semester you will create a working simulation of the Larc computer
in the Logisim logic circuit simulation program.</p>

<p>This document describes the Larc model computer and machine language.  It also
discusses a very simple Larc assembly language that 
is really just an alternative notation for the machine language, without all
the convenient features of a normal assembly language.
A <a href="larcsim.html">second&nbsp;document</a> discusses a program that
simulates the Larc computer.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Larc Computer</h3>

<p>The Larc CPU contains 16 general-purpose registers, in addition to
a PC (Program Counter) register.  Each register holds a 16-bit binary number.
The general purpose registers are numbered 0 to 15, or 0b0000 to 0b1111 in
binary; that is, a register number is a four-bit binary number.
Register number 0 has the peculiar property that its value is always zero.
</p>

<p>The main memory, or RAM, for Larc has 65536, or 2<sup>16</sup>, locations, and each
location holds a 16-bit binary number.  Locations are numbered 0 to 65535, or
0b0000000000000000 to 0b1111111111111111 in binary.  The number of a location is 
called its address.  Note that an address of a location is RAM is a 16-bit binary number.</p>

<p>A machine language (ML) instruction for Larc is a 16-bit binary number.  The structure of
the machine language is discussed below.  Any RAM location can hold one instruction, but
the contents of a memory location can also be interpreted in other ways, such as an integer
that is meant as data for the program.  The meaning of a number depends on how that number is used.</p>

<p>The operation of the computer is the basic fetch-and-execute cycle.  The 16-bit
number in the PC gives the address of the memory location that contains the next
ML instruction to be executed.  The computer fetches the instruction from that 
address, adds one to the PC, and then executes the instruction. It repeats
the cycle indefinitely until it is halted in some way.  Some instructions modify the PC when
they are executed; these are "branch" or "jump" instructions.  Adding 1 to the PC
gets the PC ready for the next instruction in the usual sequence, but the sequence
can be changed by a branch or jump.</p>

<h3>The Larc Machine Language</h3>

<p>An ML instruction is a 16-bit number.  The
four high-order bits of an instruction are an opcode that specifies the
operation encoded by the instruction, and the remaining twelve bits contain
data for the operation.  There are several formats for the data in an instruction, 
depending on the instruction's opcode.</p>


<p>The following table
describes the 16 ML instructions.  Reg[<i>n</i>] represents
the value stored in register number&nbsp;n.  The function sext(<i>x</i>) sign-extends <i>x</i>
to a 16-bit number.  The mnemonic for an instruction is
used in the assembly language notation for that instruction.  The semantics
are expressed using Java-like notation.</p>

<p>For example, the 16-bit binary number 0x0001001100100111 represents a subtraction
operation (code 0001) applied to register numbers 3, 2, and 7 (binary numbers 0011, 0010,
and 0111).  That is, when it is executed, the values from registers 2 and 7 are added, 
and the result is stored in register&nbsp;3</p>

<p>The number 0b0000100011110000 means to add the values from registers 15 and 0, and
store the result in register&nbsp;8.  Since the value in register 0 is always zero,
this has the effect of copying the value from register 15 into register&nbsp;8.</p>

<p>Or consider 0b1100000100020011.  This is a "load" command with arguments 1, 2, and 3.
It takes the value from register 2 and adds the number 3 to that value, and it uses the
result as the address of a location in memory.  The value from that location is copied
into register&nbsp;2.  (The SIMM value in a memory instruction will most often be zero.
Non-zero values are sometimes useful when you want to load a sequence of values from
consecutive memory locations.)</p>

<p>The load-upper-immediate (<i>lui</i>) command exists because a <i>limm</i> is an 8-bit value,
but a register holds a 16-bit value.  The lui command loads an 8-bit constant value
into the leftmost, or upper, eight bits of a register, and fills the lower 8 bits of
the register with zeros.  Note that it can be difficult to get an arbitrary 16-bit
constant into a register; it requires a combination of <i>lui</i>, <i>li</i>, and other commands.</p>

<p>The <i>jalr</i> command can be used to jump to any memory address.  Before jumping,
it stores the current PC value in a register to make it easy to jump back to that
address later; this can be used for calling and returning from subroutines.  The conditional
branch instructions, <i>beqz</i> and <i>bnez</i>, can only be used to jump to nearby addresses.  They add
a constant amount to current value of the PC.  The constant is treated as a signed
8-bit value, in the range -128 to 127.  Note that the constant is added to the PC value
that has already been incremented as part of the fetch-and-execute cycle, so the constant
actually gives an offset from the instruction that follows the branch instruction in memory.</p>

<p>The <i>syscall</i> instruction needs more explanation.  It really only makes sense if
the computer is running under the control of an operating system.  In a real computer,
the operating system has full access to all aspects of the computer, while other
programs have restricted access.  A <i>syscall</i> instruction is used to call subroutines
in the operating system.  This is different from calling a normal subroutine because
it means removing the restrictions that apply to normal programs.  We will not implement
an operating system, but the <a href="larcsim.html">Larc&nbsp;Simulator</a> fakes a few
system subroutines to give <i>syscall</i> something useful to do.  Note that in a real computer,
a system error, such as division by zero, also transfers control to the operating system.<p>

<h3 id="asm">Larc ML as Assembly Language Instructions</h3>


<p>An ML instruction is a 16-bit binary number.  But for our purposes,
we can also represent ML instructions in a textual form, using the mnemonics from
the above table.  An instruction is represented by a mnemonic, followed by
its arguments, separated by spaces.</p>

<p>In an assembly language command, an argument that is a register
number is represented by&nbsp;a&nbsp;$ followed by a decimal number in the range 0 to 15:
$0, $1, $2, $3,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;$15.  A <i>limm</i> immediate value, which is an 8-bit
binary number can be represented by a decimal constant in the range -128 to 255, by a hexadecimal 
constant in the range 0x00 to 0xFF, or by a binary constant in the range 0b00000000 to 0b11111111.
(Note that Java notation is always used for binary and hexadecimal constants.)
Similarly, the <i>simm</i> value in a memory instruction, which is a 4-bit binary
number, can be represented by a decimal constant in the range -8 to 7, by a hexadecimal 
constant in the range 0x0 to 0xF, or by a binary constant in the range 0b0000 to 0b1111.</p>

<p>Some examples: <i style="white-space:pre">add $2 $2 $3</i>, <i style="white-space:pre">beqz $2 -13</i>,
<i style="white-space:pre">li $1 0xF3</i>,
<i style="white-space:pre">sw $3 $2 0</i>,  <i style="white-space:pre">jalr $11 $6</i>,
<i>syscall</i>.</p>

<p>The following table shows the assembly language syntax for Larc machine language instructions.
Here, ra, rb, and rc represent register numbers in the range 0&nbsp;to&nbsp;15.  LIMM and SIMM
represent constants with the appropriate number of bits.  There are two entries for each
memory instruction, because the SIMM value can be omitted from the assembly language instruction
when its value is zero.</p>
