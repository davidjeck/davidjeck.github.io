<h3>Fifteenth Week and the End of Semester: May 6 and 13</h3>

<p>Monday, May 6 is the last day of classes.  There will be some student presentations
of their final projects.</p>

<p>Final projects are due by the final exam period, Monday, May 13, at 7:00 PM.
(Seniors are asked to turn in their projects by Sunday, May 12, since senior grades
are due earlier than other grades.)</p>

<p>There will be some student presentations during the final exam period, but 
attendance is not required.</p>

</pre>


<h3>Fourteenth Week: April 29; May 1 and 3</h3>

<p>There is a test on Monday, April 29.  A <a href="s19/test2info.html">study guide</a> was
handed out in class.</p>

<p>For the rest of the week, we should have some student presentations of final projects.
I will fill any time that is not used for presentations with discussion of topics that
didn't make it into the course.  (We might start with the proof that, if P&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;NP, then 
there is no approximation algorithm for the general traveling salesman problem.  Unfortunately,
the proof is based on the fact that HAMILTONIAN_CIRCUIT is NP-complete and you will have
to take that on faith, since we didn't prove it.</p>

<p>Since there is no final exam and no further homework assignments, whatever we do for the 
rest of the week will not be tested.  Hopefully, however, there will be some interesting things
for you to learn about.</p>

<h3>Thirteenth Week: April 22, 24, and 26</h3>

<p>We finished our look at NP-completeness and looked briefly at
approximation algorithms, Chapter 35.  We covered the approximation 
algorithm for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem.  On Friday,
we review for the test.</p>


<h3>Twelfth Week: April 15, 17, and 19</h3>

<p>This week, we will be working on NP-Completeness, Chapter 34.  We will define the classes
P and NP, look at reduction of one problem to another, and define NP-completeness.</p>


<h3>Eleventh Week: April 8, 10, and 12</h3>

<p>We will continue with Dynamic Programming, Chapter 15.  We will be covering the
longest common subsequence problem and the edit distance problem, and maybe some
of the problems from the exercises.</p>

<p>After that, we will look at some of the material from Chapter 16 on the theory
of greedy algorithms.  We will at least look at the activity selection problem
that is used as an example in that chapter.</p>

<h3>Tenth Week: April 1, 3, and 5</h3>

<p>A take-home test was distributed in class last Friday, and is due
at the start of class this Friday, April 5.</p>

<p>The topic for the week is Dynamic Programming, which is covered in Chapter&nbsp;15 in the textbook.</p>

<h3>Ninth Week: March 25, 27, and 29</h3>

<p>We will finish up our look at basic graph algorithms on Monday by considering
Dijkstra's algorithm in more detail and then covering Floyd's all-pairs shortest
path algorithm.  (We will continue to use graphs in examples and assignments.)</p>

<p>For the rest of the week, will be looking at "heuristic search."  I will discuss
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill&nbsp;climbing</a> very
briefly and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated&nbsp;annealing</a>
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic&nbsp;algorithm</a>
in more detail.</p>

<p><a href="s19/homework/hw6/hw6.html">Homework 6</a>, the programming assignment about graphs, is due on Friday, March 29.
The take-home midterm exam will be handed out on the same day and will be due
<span style="text-decoration: line-through">Wednesday</span> Friday of next week, April&nbsp;5.</p>


<h3>Eighth Week: March 11, 13, and 15</h3>

<p>We covered Kruskal's and Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithms.  In order to
implement Kruskal's algorithm efficiently, we also covered the <span class=nb>UNION-FIND</span> 
data structure, and we discussed how to use a heap to make Prim's algorithm efficient.
We looked at a proof of the correctness of Kruskal's algorithm using a loop invariant.
And at the end of the week we looked briefly at Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.</p>


<h3>Seventh Week: March 4, 6, and 8</h3>

<p>There is a test on Monday , March 4.  A <a href="s19/test1info.html">study guide</a>
was handed out in class last Wednesday.</p>

<p>After the test, we will continue our study of graphs.  We will look at topological
sort (Section 22.4) and then move on to minimum spanning tree algorithms,
Chapter&nbsp;23.</p>


<h3>Sixth Week: February 25 and 27; March 1</h3>

<p>This week, we begin one of the major topics of the course: Graphs and
graph algorithm.  We will look at the adjacency list and adjacency matrix
representations of graphs, and we will cover basic graph traversal algorithms.
The reading is Chapter 22.</p>

<p>Reminder: There is an in-class test coming up next Monday, March 4.</p>


<h3>Fifth Week:  February 18, 20, and 22</h3>

<p>We continue talking about hash tables (Chapter 11).  We will then do some work with trees,
especially binary sort trees (Chapter 12).  Then, instead of covering balanced binary sort trees
in general, we will look at another approach to balanced trees: B-Trees (Chapter 18).</p>


<h3>Fourth Week:  February 11, 13, and 15</h3>

<p>At the end of last week, we proved that a comparison sort requires &Theta;(n*log(n)) comparisons,
in the worst case (Section 8.1).  This week, we see that nevertheless there are sorting algorithms
with worst-case running time &Theta;(n).  We will cover counting sort (Section 8.2) and
radix sort (Section 8.3).  After that, we look at order statistics, such as the maximum and the
median (Sections 9.1 and 9.2).  We will then move on to hash tables (Chapter 11).</p>

<h3>Third Week:  February 4, 6, and 8</h3>

<p>We will continue to work on sorting.  After completing Heapsort and Priority Queues, we will move
on to Quicksort (Chapter 7 in the textbook).</p>




<h3>Second Week:  January 28 and 30; February 1</h3>

<p>We will finish the general, introductory material this week and move on to specific algorithms and data structures.
We will spend most of the week on analysis of algorithms, including Big-Oh notation, recurrence relations, and the
Master Theorem for solving recurrence relations.  As an example, we will cover Karatsuba's algorithm for
multiplying n-digit numbers. By Friday, hopefully, we will be able to move on to heaps and HeapSort (Chapter 6 in
the textbook.)</p>




<h3>First Week:  January 23 and 25</h3>

<p>Welcome to the course!</p>

<p>The textbook for the course is:
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844">Introduction to Algorithms</a>, 
3rd Edition, by Thomas Cormen et. al., ISBN 9780262033848.  There is a web site for the textbook, including
answers to some of the exercises and OpenCourseware video lectures from an MIT online course,
at</p>

<p align=center> <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition</a></p>

<p>In the first week of the course, we will discuss the difference between <b>problems</b> and
<b>algorithms</b>, and we will look at the design and analysis of algorithms in general terms.
The main reading for the week is Chapter 2, <i>Getting Started</i>, and Section 3.1, <i>Asymptotic Notation</i>.
We will need to review a few topics that you might or might not already be familiar with, including
summation notation and loop invariants.</p>
