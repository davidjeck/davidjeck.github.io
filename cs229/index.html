<h3>Final Exam:  Wednesday, May 5</h3>

<p>The final exam for this course takes place at 1:30 on Wednesday, May 5.  A study guide is available:<p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="s21/finalinfo.pdf">Final Exam Study Guide</a></p>

<hr>

<h3>Fourteenth Week: April 26, 28, and 30</h3>

<p>The reading for the last week of the semester is Sections 5.2 and 5.3, which cover general questions
of computability, including The Church-Turing Thesis and the unsolvability of the Halting Problem.</p>

<p><a href="s21/hw10.pdf">Homework 10</a> is due by noon on Saturday, May 1 and will not be accepted late.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Thirteenth Week: April 19, 21, and 23</h3>

<p>We started looking at general grammars, Section 4.6, last Friday.  We will continue with
general grammars on Monday.  After that, we will be moving on to Turing machines, Section&nbsp;5.1.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Twelfth Week: April 12, 14, and 16</h3>

<p>There is test on Wednesday, April 14.  <a href="s21/test2info.pdf">Click here for the study guide</a></p>

<p>We will review for the test on Monday, and will go over some of the problems from the study guide.
On Friday, we should start Section 4.6, which covers general grammars.</p>

<p><a href="s21/hw9.pdf">Homework&nbsp;9</a> is due on Monday this week.  It can 
be turned in late until noon on Sunday, April 18, but it would be a good idea to get it done before the test.
There will be no new assignment this week.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Eleventh Week: April 5, 7, and 9</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is Sections 4.3 and 4.4, which cover parsing, parse trees, and
pushdown automata.  We will, however, not cover LR(1) parsing from Section 4.3, and we
will not be putting much emphasis on pushdown automata.</p>

<p>There is a test next week, on April 14, which will cover Chapter 3 and Sections 4.1 through 4.3.
<a href="s21/hw9.pdf">Homework&nbsp;9</a> is due on Monday, April 12.  The next homework
assignment will be available some time after the test.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Tenth Week: March 29 and 31; April 2</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is Sections 3.7, 4.1, and 4.2, although we probably
need to continue with 4.2 next week.  Section 3.7 covers the Pumping Lemma for
Regular Languages, which can be used to prove that certain languages are
not regular.  Section 4.1 introduces our next category of language, context-free
languages, which are defined by context-free grammars.  Context-free languages
can be used to specify the basic syntax of most programming languages (but not
all common syntax rules).  Section 4.2 covers BNF, a notation equivalent to
context-free grammars which is often used for programming languages.</p>

<p><a href="s21/hw8.pdf">Homework 8</a> is due as usual by midnight on Wednesday
for full credit.  However, it can be turned in late until class time on Monday,
April&nbsp;5, with a 10% penalty.  The next homework assignment will not be
available until April&nbsp;5 or later.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Ninth Week: March 22, 24, and 26</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is Sections 3.5 and 3.6.  We will cover Nondeterministic
Finite-State Automata and the relationship between finite automata and regular
languages.  It turns out that regular expressions, DFAs, and NFAs all define 
the same category of languages.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Eighth Week: March 15, 17, and 19</h3>

<p>We continue with Chapter 3.  The reading for the week includes Section 3.3, which 
covers practical regular expressions, and Section 3.4, which introduces DFAs (Deterministic
Finite-State Automata).  Also included in the reading for the week is a
<a href="s21/regular-expressions.html">web&nbsp;page</a> about practical regular expressions</a>.
The new assignment this week will include some computer work with regular expression.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Seventh Week: March 6, 8, and 10</h3>

<p>We move on to Chapter 3 this week.  Chapter 3 starts with the general idea of a formal
language, then covers regular expressions, finite automata, and the relationship between them.
This is a major turning point in the course; we have finished with the purely mathematical
part and are beginning that part about theoretical computer science.
The reading for the week is Sections 3.1 and 3.2.</p>

<p><a href="s21/test1-answers.pdf">Sample answers</a> for the first test are available.</p>

<p>There was no new assignment last week, and no work is due this week.  The last time for
turning in Homework&nbsp;5 late was noon on Sunday, March&nbsp;7.</p>


<hr>
<h3>Sixth Week: March 1, 3, and 5</h3>

<p>There is a test on Friday, March 5.  A <a href="s21/test1info.pdf">study guide</a>
is available.</p>

<p>We will cover Section 2.6 this week, which covers counting, infinity, and
countable and uncountable sets.  However, this material is not on the test.</p>

<p>Homework 5 is due on Wednesday.  Because of the test, there will not be a
new homework assignment this week.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Fifth Week: February 22, 24, and 26</h3>

<p>We will continue with Chapter 2, covering sets and functions.  The reading
for the week is Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.  Looking ahead, note that the only other section
that we will cover from Chapter 2 will be Section 2.6.</p>



<hr>


<h3>Fourth Week: February 15, 17, and 19</h3>

<p>We did not get to Section 1.8 last week, so that section is
first up on Monday.  It covers a proof technique called mathematical
induction.  The reading for the week also includes Section 1.9 and
Section 2.1.  Section 1.9 talks about using induction to prove the
correctness of recursive algorithms.  Since not everyone in the class
has worked with recursive programs, this is not something that I will ask you to
do on homework or tests.  However, we will also look at some other
examples of proving program correctness.</p>

<p>We will then skip Section 1.10 and move on to Chapter 2, which
covers sets and functions.  Section 2.1 covers the basics of sets
and set notation.  Note that we will be skipping large parts of
this chapter.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Third Week: February 8, 10, and 12</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is Sections 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8.
The topic is mathematical proof, including various proof 
techniques such as direct proof, counterexample, proof 
by contradiction, and induction.  At the beginning of the
week, we still need to spend some time on formal proof (Section 1.5),
and it is likely that we will still be working on induction (Section 1.8)
early next week.</p>

<p><a href="s21/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is due by the end of
the day on Wednesday.  It can be turned in up until noon
on Saturday, but if it is turned in after midnight on Wednesday
without a good reason, there will be a 10% lateness penality.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Second Week: February 1, 3, and 5</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is Sections 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.
We have already started 1.3, which covers logic circuits, and we
will not spend much more time on that.  Section 1.4 covers
predicate logic, and Section 1.5 covers logical deduction.
These are important topics that will take some time to cover,
but hopefully we will get through them by the end of the week.</p>

<p>The <a href="s21/hw1.pdf">first homework</a> is due before
midnight on Wednesday, but it will be accepted late until Saturday
morning.  Since this is the first assignment, there will be no
penalty for turning it in late, but starting with the second
assignment, there will be a 10% penalty for work turned in
late, unless there is some good reason for it being late.</p>


<hr>


<h3>First Week: January 25, 27, and 29</h3>


<p>Welcome to the course!</p>

<p>You should download the <a href="s21/FoundationsOfComputation.pdf">PDF of the textbook</a>
(or read it in your web browser), and start reading Chapter One.  We will cover
Sections 1.1 and 1.2 from that chapter this week.  These sections introduce
propositional logic and Boolean algebra.</p>

<p>You should also carefully read the 
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/courses/cpsc229_s21.html">syllabus</a> for the course!</p>

<p>The PDF version of the textbook is free.
You will not need a printed copy, but if you would like to have one, you can order a copy from 
lulu.com at <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/david-eck-and-carol-critchlow/foundations-of-computation/paperback/product-15899474.html">this&nbsp;link</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="s21/hw1.pdf">first homework</a> will be due Wednesday of next week.  You will need to submit
your solutions in PDF form.  If you do not know how to scan your work to PDF, see 
<a href="s21/scanning-homework.html">these instructions.</a></p>
