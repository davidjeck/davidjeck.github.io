<h3>Eleventh Week:  November 4, 6, and 8</h3>

<p>This week we begin the fourth part of the textbook, moving a general consideration 
of proof techniques to a look at some specific mathematical ideas.
The topic for the week is relations, especially equivalence relations.
The reading is Chapter&nbsp;11.  You should read the entire chapter, although we will
probably still be working on it at the beginning of next week.</p>

<p>Here are my <a href="f19/8-answers.pdf">sample answers to Homework 8</a>.</p>

A <a href="f19/test2info.pdf">study&nbsp;guide</a> will be handed out in class on Monday.</p>

<p>We will continue with Chapter 10 on Monday.  On Wednesday, we will review for the
test and will finish up any part of Chapter 10 that we have not yet covered.
If there is extra time, we might start work on Chapter 11.</p>

<p><a href="f19/8-homework.pdf">Homework 8</a> is due in class on Wednesday.
Sample solutions tot he homework will be available at that time.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Ninth Week: October 21, 23, and 25</h3>

There is a test next week, on Friday, November 1, covering Chapters 4 through 10.</p>

<p>The following homework is due in class next Wednesday.  Because of the test next Friday,
I will make my solutions to this homework available when I collect the homework, so
no rewrites will be possible on this homework.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Eighth Week: October 16 and 18</h3>

<p>There is no class on Monday this week because of Fall break.</p>

<p>You should read Chapter 8, Sections 1 to 3, and Chapter 9.  I will not cover Section 8.4,
but you are certainly encouraged to read it for your own interest.  The
following problems from the textbook are due in class on Friday, October 18:</p>

<pre>
       Homework #7:
       
            Chapter 7 exercises, # 2, 8, 12, 16, 32
            
            Chapter 8 exercises, # 4, 10, 16, 22
</pre>

<p>Once we get through Chapter 9, we will spend a little time reviewing all the very
general proof techniques from Chapters 4 through 9 before going on to Chapter 10.</p>


<hr>

<h3>Seventh Week: October 7, 9, and 11</h3>

<p>The reading for the week is Chapter 7 and starting Chapter 8.  We will continue
talking about proof techniques.  Chapter 7 covers "if and only if" proofs and
existence proofs.  Chapter 8 discusses how to prove things about sets.</p>

<p>Your <a href="f19/5-homework.pdf">LaTeX homework</a> is due on Monday.  There is also a 
written homework assignment due on Wednesday:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="f19/6-homework.pdf">Homework #6</a></p>

<hr>

<h3>Sixth Week: September 30; October 2 and 4</h3>

<p>We will continue studying proof techniques for the next few weeks.
The reading for the week is Chapters 5 and 6 in the textbook, which
cover proof by contrapositive and proof by contradiction.</p>

<p>But we will also be doing something different at the beginning
of this week.  We will look at the LaTeX typesetting system, which
is used to produce high-quality mathematical texts such as textbooks
and journal articles, as well as many of the handouts for this course.
I will ask every student to get a free account on the  on-line
LaTeX web site, <a href="https://overleaf.com">overleaf.com</a>, and
to use it to write some mathematics, probably including your
next homework assignment.</p>

<p>The next homework assignment is due next Monday, October 7.  It
will be written in LaTeX on overleaf.com.  The assignment was handed out in class,
and you can get a copy here:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/hdntpsqyczwh">https://www.overleaf.com/read/hdntpsqyczwh</a></p>

<p>A <a href="http://math.hws.edu/gassert/LaTeX_Guide_Title.pdf">Guide to LaTeX</a>, written by
Professor Alden Gassert, will also be handed out in class.  Note that the features that
are documented as requiring Prof. Gassert's TeX file are not available for the first
homework assignment.  Also, note that there is a lot of information in the guide
that you won't need yet.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Fifth Week: September 23, 25, and 27</h3>

<p>There is a test on Friday, September 27.  A <a href="f19/test1info.pdf">study guide for the test</a> 
will be handed out in class on Monday.  The following homework is due on
Wednesday:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="f19/4-homework.pdf">Homework #4</a></p>

<p>We will spend Monday working on proofs and Wednesday doing review for the test.
You can read the rest of Chapter 4, Sections 4 and 5.  We might or might get to those 
Sections or Wednesday but in any case, they are not on the test.</p>

<p>My <a href="f19/1-answers.pdf" style="white-space: pre">answers for Homework #1</a> and
my <a href="f19/3-answers.pdf" style="white-space: pre">answers for Homework #3</a> are
available here.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Fourth Week: September 16, 18, and 20</h3>

<p>The homework problems from the textbook that were assigned last week [see below]
are due on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The reading for the week is to finish Chapter 2 and to read Sections 1 through 3
in Chapter&nbsp;4.  Note that we will not cover Chapter&nbsp;3.  We will finish up
the general introduction to formal logic from Chapter&nbsp;2.  We will then move on to
Chapter&nbsp;4, which begins the discussion of proof and methods of proof.
In particular, Section 4.3 covers the most important single proof technique: direct proof.</p>

<p>There is a test coming up at the end of next week, on Friday, September 27.  It will
cover everything up through Section 4.3, but will not cover any material beyond that that
we do next week.</p>

<p>Homework for next Wednesday will be posted soon.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Third Week: September 9, 11, and 13</h3>

<p><a href="f19/2-homework.pdf">Homework #2</a> is due on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The reading for the week is Chapter 2, Sections 1 through 7.  This week, we begin our
study of mathematical logic.  We will look at propositional logic, which concerns statements
that can be either true or false, and logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and IMPLIES.
Hopefully, by the end of the week, we will get to Section&nbsp;7, which introduces 
the quantifiers FOR ALL and THERE EXISTS.</p>

<p>The following homework from the textbook is due in class next Wednesday:</p>

<pre>
       Section 2.1, Exercises 2, 4, 8, 10  &mdash; if it's not a statement, explain why
       Section 2.3, Exercises 2, 4, 10  &mdash; no explanation necessary
       Section 2.4, Exercises 2, 4   &mdash; no explanation necessary
       Section 2.6, Exercises 2, 8, 10, 12, 14  &mdash; some explanation necessary!
       Section 2.7, Exercises 2, 4, 6  &mdash; give English translation and <b>why</b> it is true or false
</pre>

<p>(Note:  There won't be any rewrites for this homework, since there are no "proofs".)</p>

<hr>


<h3>Second Week: September 2, 4, and 6</h3>

<p>We will finish Chapter 1 early in the week.  For the rest of the week, we
will work on a handout about <i>topology</i>.  In particular, we will be looking
at the basic definitions in a branch of topology known as <i>point-set topology</i>,
which will allow us to apply some of the things that we have been learning
about sets.</p>

<p>You should finish reading Chapter 1 by Monday.  For Wednesday, you should
read the handout about topology, which will be distributed in class and
is also available through this link:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="f19/handouts/1-topology.pdf">Handout 1: Topology</a></p>

<p>This homework on the topology handout is due in class next <b>Wednesday</b> (changed from the original due date):</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="f19/2-homework.pdf">Homework #2</a></p>

<p>I will need to leave my Thursday office hours early this week, at 1:50.
However, I will be available earlier in the day from 10:00 to 12:00.</p>


<hr>


<h3>First Week: August 26, 28, and 30</h3>

<p>Welcome to the course!</p>

<p>As a reading assignment for the week, you should read Chapter 1 in the textbook, although we
might not finish the entire chapter this week in class.
